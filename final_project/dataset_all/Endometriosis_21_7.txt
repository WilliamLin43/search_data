Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) in young women, with previous gynecological abdominal surgery, is the first condition considered by many practitioners when a tumor in the region of the scar appears. AWE seems to be caused by an iatrogenic transfer of endometrial cells at the level of the scar. The onset of the disease may be late in many cases. Despite the fact that the disease could be totally asymptomatic, there are certain risk factors that can be identified during the anamnesis, such as: heredity, menarche at the age of >14 years, menstrual cycle <27 days, delayed menopause, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption. Suggestive signs include cyclic or continuous abdominal pain caused by a palpable abdominal wall mass with a maximum tenderness in the region of the surgical scar. The differential diagnosis is complex and rare entities like desmoid tumors (DTs) must be taken into consideration. Desmoid tumor, or the so-called aggressive fibromatosis (AF), is a rare fibroblastic proliferation. This tumor can develop in any muscular aponeurotic structure of the body and is considered benign but with a high recurrence rate. DTs can cause local infiltration, subsequently producing certain levels of deformity and potential obstruction of vital structures and organs. The differential diagnosis is challenging in this situations, the imagery exams are useful, especially in detecting the precise location of the tumor. The histological examination of the tumor can state the final and precise diagnosis.
