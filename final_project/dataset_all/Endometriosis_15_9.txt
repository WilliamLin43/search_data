BACKGROUND Endometriosis is a unique entity described in ample literature as the decidualization of endometrial tissues under the influence of gynecological hormones outside the uterine cavity. The post-surgical presence of ectopic endometrial tissue on the skin is known as abdominal wall endometriosis, cutaneous endometriosis, or scar endometriosis. Iatrogenic implantation of detached endometrial tissues at the incision site is the most widely accepted theory for this rare monad. The unspecific scar endometriosis presentation makes it challenging to diagnose. Moreover, it can easily be confused with hematoma, hernia, lipoma, abscess, scar granuloma, and tumor. Here, we report and discuss a rare case of scar endometriosis with various available treatment modalities. CASE REPORT We delineate a case of a 39-year-old woman with abdominal wall cutaneous endometriosis. An "inverted T" incision opened the abdominal and uterine cavity as it was a problematic preterm breech in labor. After an uneventful postoperative and postpartum period, she presented with a painful, discolored nodular mass of approximately 3 cm in diameter at the left border of the cesarian scar, developed over 1.5 years, often accompanied by drainage of brownish discharge. Ultrasonography with color Doppler showed a hypoechoic lesion with internal vascularity, corroborated our preliminary diagnosis of scar endometriosis, which was further confirmed by surgical excision and histopathology. CONCLUSIONS A proper surgical resection is the standard treatment line for scar endometriosis. However, patients need regular follow-up to look for recurrences, even after treatment. Further studies are recommended to establish factors associated with cutaneous endometriosis recurrence.
