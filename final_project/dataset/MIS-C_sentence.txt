In early 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rare cases were reported in children and adolescents of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).MIS-C is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction and usually presents late in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Since May 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded all reported cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and adolescents in the USA.In April 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised its clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing hyperinflammation and MIS-C.There are several challenges ahead for preventing, diagnosing, and managing MIS-C, particularly following the rapid emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2.This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C and includes some updates from population studies and clinical guidelines. BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1.A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution.Case 2.A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance.The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion.The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone.However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution.CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines. A retrospective cohort study provides further insight into the 6-month outcomes of children with MIS-C, highlighting the importance of physical and mental rehabilitation. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with thrombotic complications in adults, but the incidence of COVID-19-related thrombosis in children and adolescents is unclear.Most children with acute COVID-19 have mild disease, but coagulopathy has been associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a postinfectious complication.We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence of thrombosis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C and evaluate associated risk factors.We classified patients into 1 of 3 groups for analysis: COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2.Among a total of 853 admissions (COVID-19, n = 426; MIS-C, n = 138; and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2, n = 289) in 814 patients, there were 20 patients with thrombotic events (TEs; including 1 stroke).Patients with MIS-C had the highest incidence (9 [6.5%] of 138) vs COVID-19 (9 [2.1%] of 426) or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (2 [0.7%] of 289).In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, a majority of TEs (89%) occurred in patients age 12 years.Patients age 12 years with MIS-C had the highest rate of thrombosis at 19% (9 of 48).Notably, 71% of TEs that were not present on admission occurred despite thromboprophylaxis.Multivariable analysis identified the following as significantly associated with thrombosis: age 12 years, cancer, presence of a central venous catheter, and MIS-C.In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, hospital mortality was 2.3% (13 of 564), but it was 28% (5 of 18) in patients with TEs.Our findings may help inform pediatric thromboprophylaxis strategies. A term infant with persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn developed clinical and laboratory features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in childhood (MIS-C) between days 12 and 14.Mother and baby were anti-SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG positive and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM negative on day 18, with negative COVID-19 PCR on repeated testing; possible first documentation of neonatal MIS-C following passive transfer of maternal antibodies. We describe six teenagers presenting with fever and severe abdominal symptoms admitted with concerns for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, and increased D-dimers.Imaging studies revealed multifocal airspace disease and ground-glass opacities.SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction and serologies were negative.All patients reported a history of vaping, prompting E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) diagnosis.MIS-C has overlapping clinical and laboratory features highlighting the added challenge of diagnosing EVALI during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keywords COVID-19 pandemic, EVALI, MIS-C. In early 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rare cases were reported in children and adolescents of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).MIS-C is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction and usually presents late in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Since May 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded all reported cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and adolescents in the USA.In April 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised its clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing hyperinflammation and MIS-C.There are several challenges ahead for preventing, diagnosing, and managing MIS-C, particularly following the rapid emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2.This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C and includes some updates from population studies and clinical guidelines. In The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Zhu et al.1 report that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) targets IL-1+ neutrophils to exert anti-inflammatory effects in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a post-infectious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19. Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a major complication of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in pediatric patients.Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation.Children with MIS-C present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms.We performed a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in children with SARS-CoV-2.We hypothesized that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of disease.Protein signatures demonstrated overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is a key marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA.We found that IFN responses are dysregulated in MIS-C patients, and that IFN levels delineate clinical heterogeneity. Initially, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spared children from severe disease.However, after the initial wave of infections, clusters of a novel hyperinflammatory disease have been reported in regions with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.While the characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains unknown.Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases.We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal isotype-switching and neutralization capability.We further profiled the secreted immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, CCL28).Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues.Markers of activated myeloid function were also evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses.Finally, to assess the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens.All patients were treated with anti- IL6R antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization of inflammatory markers. Myocarditis has a wide array of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death.Pediatric myocarditis is a rare disease, with an estimated annual incidence of 1 to 2 per 100,000 children though its true prevalence remains unknown due to its variable and often subclinical presentation.The diagnosis of myocarditis is challenging in the era of COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can have overlapping clinical conundrum.Here, we present a case of a 17-year-old male presenting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, and electrocardiogram (EKG) findings concerning for myocardial injury along with elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate), and CRP (C-Reactive Protein).We discuss the key elements of our clinical experience with this case and review the literature for pediatric myocarditis, with a focus on differentiating it from MIS-C in the current COVID-19 pandemic era. A significant surge in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C, also called Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - PIMS) has been observed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.MIS-C shares many clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), although clinical course and outcomes are divergent.We analyzed whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues from these patients using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures, i.e., the 166-gene viral pandemic (ViP) signature, and its 20-gene severe (s)ViP subset that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a 13-transcript signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD.Our analyses revealed that KD and MIS-C are on the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19.While both the pediatric syndromes converge upon an IL15/IL15RA -centric cytokine storm, suggestive of shared proximal pathways of immunopathogenesis, they diverge in other laboratory parameters and cardiac phenotypes.The ViP signatures also revealed unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity. Recent studies on the pathogenesis and clinical spectrum of human disease following infection with the new human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, have identified the varied presentations and sequelae of COVID-19.Acute cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 results in multiorgan damage due to vascular hyperpermeability, edema, and hypercoagulation.The long-term consequences of infection from SARS-CoV-2 include long COVID.or post-COVID syndrome, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Several case reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) have shown the presentation at more than four weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in adults more than 21 years of age.In September 2021, a published systematic review of the literature identified 221 patients with MIS-A, representing the most comprehensive clinical study to date.MIS-A occurs in the post-acute COVID-19 period.The pathogenesis may involve a dysregulated antibody-mediated immune response, similar to MIS-C.Therefore, patients with MIS-A may respond to supportive therapies that control hyperinflammation.This Editorial aims to describe MIS-A and discuss COVID-19 as a spectrum of hyperinflammatory disease in terms of severity, extent, duration, and patient age. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) presents with fever, inflammation and multiple organ involvement in individuals under 21 years following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.To identify genes, pathways and cell types driving MIS-C, we sequenced the blood transcriptomes of MIS-C cases, pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019, and healthy controls.We define a MIS-C transcriptional signature partially shared with the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the signature of Kawasaki disease, a clinically similar condition.By projecting the MIS-C signature onto a co-expression network, we identified disease gene modules and found genes downregulated in MIS-C clustered in a module enriched for the transcriptional signatures of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and CD56 dim CD57 + NK cells.Bayesian network analyses revealed nine key regulators of this module, including TBX21 , a central coordinator of exhausted CD8 + T-cell differentiation.Together, these findings suggest dysregulated cytotoxic lymphocyte response to SARS-Cov-2 infection in MIS-C. Children are infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as often as adults, but with fewer symptoms.During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C), with symptoms similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was described in young minors testing positive for COVID-19.The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined MIS-C as occurring in <21-year-olds, triggering hundreds of PubMed-listed papers.However, postpubertal adolescents are no longer children biologically; the term MIS-C is misleading.Furthermore, MIS also occurs in adults, termed MIS-A by the CDC.Acute and delayed inflammations can be triggered by COVID-19.The 18th birthday is an administrative not a biological age limit, whereas the body matures slowly during puberty.This blur in defining children leads to confusion regarding MIS-C/MIS-A.United States and European Union (EU) drug approval is handled separately for children, defined as <18-year-olds, ascribing non-existent physical characteristics up to the 18th birthday.This blur between the administrative and the physiological meanings for the term child is causing flawed demands for pediatric studies in all drugs and vaccines, including those against COVID-19.Effective treatment of all conditions, including COVID-19, should be based on actual physiological need.Now, the flawed definition for children in the development of drugs and vaccines and their approval is negatively impacting prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in minors.This review reveals the necessity for redefining pediatric age groups to rapidly establish recommendations for optimal prevention and treatment in minors. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that can result in serious illness in the paediatric population but our understanding of this syndrome is in its infancy.Translational studies in 2020 leveraging immune profiling have laid the foundation to enable further discovery in MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) is a post-infectious complication described in children and adolescents with previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.Because of its potential to evolve to severe disease -including cardiovascular impairment and multiple organ failure it requires a prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, including intensive care for most cases.These guidelines compile recent information from scientific literature, from our local clinical experiences during the past pandemic year, and have been discussed by experts.The recommendations provided are meant to help the clinical work of health teams attending the pediatric population. BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1.A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution.Case 2.A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance.The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion.The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone.However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution.CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines. Children and adolescents infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are predominantly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms compared with the more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) described in adults.However, SARS-CoV-2 is also associated with a widely reported but poorly understood paediatric systemic vasculitis.This multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has features that overlap with myocarditis, toxic-shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease.Current evidence indicates that MIS-C is the result of an exaggerated innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a cytokine storm, and that it is triggered by prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure.Epidemiological, clinical and immunological differences classify MIS-C as being distinct from Kawasaki disease.Differences include the age range, and the geographical and ethnic distribution of patients.MIS-C is associated with prominent gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system involvement, admission to intensive care unit, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, high levels of IFN and low counts of naive CD4+ T cells, with a high proportion of activated memory T cells.Further investigation of MIS-C will continue to enhance our understanding of similar conditions associated with a cytokine storm. BACKGROUND Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, children who were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) with vascular inflammation were described as having a vasculitis similar to Kawasakis disease.There are now consensus clinical guidelines that have described the presentation and diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.This report aims to describe a case of MIS-C in an 11-year-old Saudi Arabian girl who presented with coronary artery aneurysm and cardiac involvement.CASE REPORT We describe an 11-year-old Saudi girl who was asymptomatic for 3 weeks after contracting SARS-CoV-2.Three weeks after suffering a mild flulike illness, she developed a high fever, cough, and severe clinical deterioration within 12 h of admission, including shock, rash, pleural effusion, high inflammatory markers, and a coronary aneurysm.As per current practice, the diagnosis was confirmed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome based on a SARS-CoV-2 test with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 2 nasopharyngeal aspirates.Her condition was successfully treated with antibiotics, inotropes, IVIG, aspirin, and Tocilizumab, in addition to high-flow oxygen therapy.Eventually, she was able to return home after fully recovering.CONCLUSIONS The findings in this report suggest that children with MIS-C due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can have a good prognosis, even when they suffer from coronary artery and cardiac involvement.The increasing number of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that affect children supports the importance of RT-PCR for the COVID-19 diagnostic test for children with multisystem or cardiovascular inflammation, which may guide the most appropriate clinical management of the variants of MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is an infrequent and poorly understood illness.It can present as severe multiorgan failure in children, potentially lethal.Immunomodulation is the empiric treatment because a dysregulated immune response is the primary pathophysiologic mechanism.We present an infant with severe MIS-C, refractory to usual treatment, successfully treated with plasmapheresis. As of May 2020, an emerging immune-mediated syndrome mainly affecting children has been detected primarily in Europe and the United States.The incidence of this syndrome appears to mirror the initial infectious assault, with a delay of several weeks.This syndrome has been termed "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children" (MIS-C) and is observed in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The phenotypes of presentation include several characteristic features, including prolonged fever, skin eruption, neck stiffness, and gastrointestinal manifestations with pronounced abdominal pain.Shock and organ dysfunction on presentation are frequent but inconsistent, whereas respiratory distress is typically and notably absent.We have reviewed recently published data aiming to better understand MIS-C, with a focus on its mucocutaneous manifestations. As of May 2020, an emerging immune-mediated syndrome primarily affecting children has been detected primarily in Europe and the United States.The incidence of this syndrome appears to mirror the initial infectious assault with a delay of several weeks.This syndrome has been termed "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children" (MIS-C) and is observed in association with the coronavirus disease 2019.The phenotypes of presentation include several characteristic features, including prolonged fever, skin eruptions, neck stiffness, and gastrointestinal manifestations with pronounced abdominal pain.Shock and organ dysfunction on presentation are frequent but inconsistent, whereas respiratory distress is typically, and notably, absent.We have reviewed the recent published data aiming to better understand MIS-C, with a focus on its mucocutaneous manifestations. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) affects a small percentage of pediatric patients infected with COVID-19 and is characterized by fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem involvement, and severe illness necessitating hospitalization.Skin findings are often present in these patients, and when initially compared with Kawasaki disease, they likely represent distinct phenomena and overall remain poorly characterized.In this retrospective review of 34 case reports and series, we identified cutaneous manifestations documented in 417 of 736 patients (57%) with MIS-C associated with COVID-19."Rash" was the sole descriptor of skin findings in nearly half of patients.Case reports and smaller case series provided more detail, outlining a broad range of lesion morphologies (polymorphic, maculopapular, morbilliform, erythrodermic, urticarial, reticular, petechial, purpuric) in variable anatomic distribution.More thorough descriptions of dermatologic manifestations in patients with MIS-C are warranted to better characterize this syndrome, as they may lend important insight into pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are inflammatory conditions that present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician.Although many of their features overlap, they are two distinct conditions.KD is a febrile illness most commonly affecting children younger than five years.It manifests with prolonged fever and at least four of the following features: bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, mucositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy of 1.5 cm or more in diameter.Patients with MIS-C may have many of the same manifestations but tend to have higher rates of gastrointestinal and neurocognitive symptoms and signs of shock on presentation.Both conditions are associated with cardiac sequelae, including coronary artery aneurysms, although children with MIS-C are at high risk of developing ventricular dysfunction and depressed cardiac output.Lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide are key laboratory findings of MIS-C that can help distinguish it from KD.The use of intravenous immune globulin is well established in KD and also appears to have a role in the treatment of MIS-C. Aspirin has been used in KD for an anti-inflammatory effect, and low-dose aspirin is recommended for MIS-C to reduce the risk of thrombosis.In addition to supportive care, patients with MIS-C may benefit from immunomodulatory medications, although data on this topic are evolving. Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown cause affecting children under 5 years of age.It is thought to be triggered by several viruses.Recently, Kawasaki-like disease has been reported worldwide in patients with COVID-19, giving rise to a new term of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We report a case of a previously healthy 7-year boy, referred to our hospital with provisional diagnosis of measles due to generalised erythematous, maculopapular rash and conjunctivitis.On detailed evaluation, the patient fulfilled the clinical and laboratory criteria of MIS-C, and COVID-19 antibodies were positive.He was treated successfully with high dose of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and methylprednisolone.Patient was followed one week later with repeat echocardiography, which showed improvement.In conclusion, early recognition and timely treatment can prevent adverse outcomes in MIS-C. Key Words: COVID-19, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but life-threatening inflammatory immune response associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.The majority of patients have been presented with hypotension, shock, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and mucocutaneous symptoms.The incidence of neurologic symptoms in MIS-C is of rising concern as they are not well described and reported in fewer patients.An 8-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with headache, fever, conjunctivitis, and hyperinflammatory findings diagnosed as MIS-C. Fundus examination performed with complaints of headache, vomiting, and conjunctivitis showed bilateral papilledema.Pseudotumor cerebri is a rare manifestation of MIS-C that can lead to vision loss and may not only be resolved with the standard treatment for MIS-C. We report a case of MIS-C presented with neurologic symptoms due to pseudotumor cerebri and successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and acetazolamide. To characterize the new SARS-Co-V-2 related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among Israeli children and to compare it with Kawasaki disease (KD).We compared, in two medical centers, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of MIS-C, KD and an intermediate group, which met the case definitions of both conditions.MIS-C patients were older, were more likely to be hypotensive, to have significant gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia and to have non-coronary abnormal findings in their echocardiogram.Lymphopenia was an independent predictor of MIS-C.Most of our MIS-C patients responded promptly to corticosteroid therapy.KD incidence in both centers was similar in 2019 and 2020.Although there is clinical overlap between KD and MIS-C, these are separate entities.Lymphopenia clearly differentiates between these entities.MIS-C patients may benefit from corticosteroids as first-line therapy. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age.While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasakis disease.Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease.There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs.Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children.Here, we define immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen receptor repertoire analysis, unbiased serum proteomics, and in vitro assays.Despite no evidence of active infection, we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways including cytokines, complement/coagulation, and fluid shear stress in MIS-C patients.Moreover, NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated, and plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded.Consistently, we detect elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture.Thus, we define immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children. As the world came to terms with the current COVID-19 pandemic, children were initially thought to have milder disease than adults with significantly lower morbidity and mortality.The emergence of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first recognized in Europe, and then across centers in the United States.Early and widespread data sharing among centers across the world was extremely helpful in early identification and treatment of these children, with a good prognosis in a majority of cases.Significant research is required to answer several questions that have been raised, including susceptibility, long-term effects, and pathogenesis and treatment options to name a few. Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a postinfectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).This syndrome is marked by cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction, often affecting the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, and the hematopoietic system.We describe the case of a 16-year-old boy with an initial presentation of severe inflammatory bowel disease and concurrent MIS-C.He presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia and met criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.Laboratory inflammatory profiling revealed markedly elevated ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, soluble interleukin 2, and interleukin 6 levels.Endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed severe active gastroduodenitis, patchy colitis, and a normal-appearing terminal ileum.The patient was treated with a combination of steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and infliximab, and his symptoms slowly resolved over a 3-week period.In this case, we describe coincident MIS-C with a remarkably severe and difficult-to-treat initial presentation of inflammatory bowel disease and highlight the need to investigate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 and MIS-C on inflammatory disorders. Les rpercussions de la maladie au coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) sur la morbidit et la mortalit chez les enfants se sont rvles relativement faibles.Si un enfant se prsente ma clinique avec une fivre persistante et une hyperinflammation systmique sans aucune exposition connue la COVID-19, quelle est la probabilit quil soit atteint du syndrome inflammatoire multisystmique de lenfant (MIS-C)?Que sait-on actuellement du MIS-C et quel est le pronostic pour les enfants qui en souffrent?RPONSE: En plein cur de la pandmie de la COVID-19, lmergence dun nouveau problme prsente encore une fois un dfi additionnel aux cliniciens, aux professionnels de la sant publique et la population pdiatrique.Le syndrome inflammatoire multisystmique chez les enfants est rare, mais potentiellement grave, et il a t observ chez des enfants dont la maladie la COVID-19 a t confirme environ 2 6 semaines avant lapparition des symptmes.Au nombre des signes et des symptmes courants figurent une fivre persistante, une hyperinflammation systmique, des malaises gastro-intestinaux (p. ex.douleurs abdominales, vomissements, diarrhe), des changements mucocutans (p. ex.ruptions cutanes, conjonctivite), une cphale ou une dysfonction cardiaque.tant donn que de nombreux enfants sont asymptomatiques ou ne prsentent que des symptmes lgers de la COVID-19, le dveloppement du MIS-C peut sembler soudain et surprenant aux familles et aux mdecins.Mme si les enfants atteints du MIS-C ncessitent habituellement une hospitalisation, les issues sont largement favorables grce une reconnaissance rapide du syndrome et une thrapie intense. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious, sometimes life-threatening late complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with multiorgan involvement and evidence of immune activation.The pathogenesis of MIS-C is not known, nor is the pathogenesis of the severe organ damage that is the hallmark of MIS-C. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), the virus responsible for roseola, is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that causes close to universal infection by the age of 3 years.HHV-6 remains latent for life and can be activated during inflammatory states, by other viruses, and by host cell apoptosis.HHV-6 has been associated with end-organ diseases, including hepatitis, carditis, and encephalitis.In addition, 1% of people have inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (iciHHV-6), which is HHV-6 that has been integrated into chromosomal telomeric regions and is transmitted through the germ line.iciHHV-6 can be reactivated and has been associated with altered immune responses.We report here a case of MIS-C in which an initial high HHV-6 DNA polymerase chain reaction viral load assay prompted testing for iciHHV-6, which yielded a positive result.Additional research may be warranted to determine if iciHHV-6 is commonly observed in patients with MIS-C and, if so, whether it may play a part in MIS-C pathogenesis. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious postinfectious immune dysregulation associated with coronavirus disease 2019 that may present with severe and life-threatening cardiovascular dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, shock, and multisystem organ failure.Optimal treatment is unknown.Current standard of care consists of nonspecific anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic therapies.Interventions that target MIS-Cs distinctive clinical features and immunophenotype are indicated.Remestemcel-L, an investigational mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, is a promising candidate for treatment of MIS-C because of its beneficial anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, endothelial function and vascular stabilizing effects, which align well with the pathophysiology of MIS-C.Here, we present the first two patients with life-threatening MIS-C ever treated with remestemcel-L under an expanded access program.Both were previously healthy children without any indication of previous coronavirus disease 2019 infection or exposure.They presented with severe clinical illness including myocardial dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and shock.At the time of hospital admission, both had negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results and positive serology results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Both children received standard of care MIS-C treatment.Although the patients showed some clinical improvement, left ventricular ejection fraction remained reduced and inflammatory biomarkers remained significantly elevated.When treated with two intravenous doses of remestemcel-L separated by 48 hours, rapid normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction, notable reductions in biomarkers of systemic and cardiac inflammation, and improved clinical status occurred.Neither child experienced adverse effects associated with remestemcel-L administration.This treatment appears promising as a novel immunomodulatory cellular therapy for children with clinically significant cardiovascular manifestations of MIS-C. An alarming increase in children presenting with fever, hyperinflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction frequently requiring intensive care has been observed after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.The illness resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), with coronary dilatation and aneurysm occurring in some.However, the cardiovascular manifestations were typically on the severe end of the KD spectrum, with cardiogenic shock a common presentation together with other features.This led to defining a unique syndrome named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).In this issue of the JCI, Lee and Day-Lewis et al.and Diorio et al.explored the clinical profiles associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in children.We posit that while splitting MIS-C into a separate disease may aid clinical management decisions, lumping it into the KD pot may better serve to understand pathobiology. The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global pandemic since December 2019.More than 35 million people have been affected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than one million deaths worldwide.Michigan was one of the top three states in the United States that was severely affected by the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic with more than 7000 deaths in adults and greater than 145,000 confirmed infections.However, compared to adults, the majority of children until recently were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness with SARS-CoV-2.Recently, a rare but potentially serious presentation associated with SARS-CoV-2 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been recently reported and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a case definition for the same.We report the clinical and laboratory presentations and outcomes of 34 children with MIS-C who were evaluated within a 12 week period at a pediatric emergency department (PED) of single institution in Michigan.These cases presented approximately three weeks after the peak of adult SAR-CoV-2 related deaths occurred in the state.While many children presented with clinical characteristics similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD), they also exhibited certain unique features which differentiated MIS-C from KD.The information presented below will aid clinicians with early recognition, evaluation and management of MIS-C in the emergency department. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) occurs during or recently following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and is characterized by persistent fever, inflammation, and severe illness requiring hospitalization.The majority of patients with MIS-C also present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.In this issue of the JCI, Yonker, Gilboa, and colleagues identified zonulin as a biomarker of GI permeability in children with MIS-C and present the results of an intriguing proof-of-concept study indicating that zonulin may represent a potential therapeutic target for MIS-C treatment and prevention.Their findings suggest that intestinal mucosal dysfunction and epithelial barrier breakdown may represent a biological mechanism underlying the development of MIS-C in SARS-CoV-2-infected children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but deadly new disease in children that rapidly progresses to hyperinflammation and shock, and can lead to multiple organ failure if unrecognized.It has been found to be temporally associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and is often associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure in children.In this issue of the JCI, Porritt, Paschold, et al.identify restricted T cell receptor (TCR) -chain variable domain (V) usage in patients with severe MIS-C, indicating a potential role for SARS-CoV-2 as a superantigen.These findings suggest that a blood test that determines the presence of specific TCR variable gene (TRBV) segments may identify patients at risk for severe MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an emerging disease described in children in association with infection or epidemiological link to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Signs and symptoms include fever, rash, and cardiac dysfunction; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have put forth broad criteria for diagnosis.The illness is serious and can progress rapidly to heart failure and death.However, findings in MIS-C are nonspecific, and there is significant overlap with other systemic illnesses, including Kawasaki disease and several viral and bacterial infections.We present 5 children admitted to a teaching hospital within an 11-day period in May 2020 for MIS-C evaluation who were later diagnosed with murine typhus.Typhus is a rickettsial infection that presents with fever and rash, and, although usually self-limited, responds well to treatment with doxycycline to shorten the course of illness.Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these children are presented to illustrate similarities to MIS-C, which can also be shared with viral, bacterial, or other regional endemic infections, as well as noninfectious inflammatory diseases.This case series serves to remind pediatric hospitalists to be vigilant to avoid premature closure on MIS-C for children admitted with fever and systemic inflammation.Maintaining a wide differential diagnosis in approaching such patients is of utmost importance as community exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely and evidence of past infection becomes commonplace. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious complication that is observed most commonly in pediatric patients following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections.However, the mechanism and predictors of disease are poorly understood.There are no prior reports of MIS-C among patients who have been fully vaccinated, and only a single case of MIS in an adult patient who had received his second shot just 4 days prior to symptom onset.Here, we present an adolescent with sickle cell disease who was fully vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and had no prior history of known or suspected infection, who presented in shock and was ultimately diagnosed with MIS-C.This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion for MIS-C even when patients are fully vaccinated. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe, life-threatening, post-COVID-19 hyperinflammatory illness that is not yet fully understood.In this issue of Med, de Cevins et al.used a multi-parametric approach to define COVID-19-related disease, specifically identifying a molecular signature of the most severe form of COVID-19-related illness: MIS-C with myocarditis.1. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection is well known.We describe a 12-year-old child developing MIS-C after receiving 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines without clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection.A possible association between the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and MIS-C cannot be excluded. Most of the reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children reported mild-to-moderate disease manifestations.However, recent reports explored a rare pediatric multisystem syndrome possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).The study prospectively enrolled 5 patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.They were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).Their clinical presentation, laboratory, and outcome were described.All patients shared similar clinical presentations such as persistent documented fever for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, and ferritin).Three patients had concurrent positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and the other 2 patients had contact with suspected COVID-19 positive patients.They were all managed in the PICU and received intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroid, and hydroxychloroquine.The hospital stays ranged between 3 and 21 days.One patient died due to severe multiorgan failures and shock, and the other 4 patients were discharged with good conditions.Pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for MIS-C. MIS-C has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory presentations, and the clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and should initiate its early treatment to avoid unfavorable outcomes.Long-term follow-up studies will be required to explore any sequelae of MIS-C, precisely the cardiovascular complications. The pathophysiology of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C) is unknown.It occurs several weeks after COVID-19 infection or exposure; however, MIS is rarely reported after COVID-19 vaccination, and cases are mostly in adults.Herein, we present a 12-year-old male who had no prior COVID-19 infection or exposure and developed MIS-C after his first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. In April 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe, a cluster of children with hyperinflammatory shock with features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome was reported in England* (1).The patients signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2-4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1).The clinical signs and symptoms present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1).On May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case definition, and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases to local and state health departments.As of July 29, a total of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to CDC.A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results.The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2-4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease.Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults has been associated with thrombosis.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with COVID-19 case series have reported high fibrinogen levels, but it is not known whether this causes thrombophilia.We report two patients needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) who both suffered thrombotic complications.We retrospectively reviewed patients with MIS-C needing ECMO support admitted to a single Paediatric and Cardiac Intensive Care Unit within a regional center for MIS-C in South East England.Two children required ECMO for cardiovascular support.Both developed thrombotic events despite receiving heparin infusions at dosing higher than the interquartile range for our ECMO population.Case 1 developed a right anterior and middle cerebral artery infarct, which led to his death.Case 2 had a right atrial thrombus, which resolved without complication.When compared with patients undergoing ECMO in the same institution in pre-MIS-C era, fibrinogen levels were consistently higher before and during ECMO therapy.MIS-C patients presenting with hyperfibrinogenemia are likely to have a propensity toward thrombotic complications; this must be considered when optimizing the anticoagulation strategy on ECMO. Background.A novel coronavirus identified in 2019 leads to a pandemic of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with important morbidity and mortality.Initially, children seemed minimally affected, but there were reports of cases similar to (atypical) Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, and evidence emerges about a complication named paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Case Presentations.Two cases were compared and discussed demonstrating varying presentations, management, and evolution of MIS-C.These cases are presented to increase awareness and familiarity among paediatricians and emergency physicians with the different clinical manifestations of this syndrome.Discussion.MIS-C may occur with possible diverse clinical presentations.Early recognition and treatment are paramount for a beneficial outcome. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a rare, potentially life-threatening postinfectious complication in children after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can recur upon reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.Here, we report on a former MIS-C patient who was reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 without recurrence of MIS-C. Comparing first and second wave MIS-C cohorts at our quaternary pediatric institution, second wave were older, presented more frequently with shortness of breath, higher maximum troponin and N-terminal BNP, and more frequently required advanced respiratory and inotropic support.Despite increased severity in the second cohort, both cohorts had similar rates of coronary artery abnormalities, systolic dysfunction, and length of stay. This is a case of a 15-year-old male with an initial diagnosis of a retropharyngeal phlegmon who ultimately developed new symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with MIS-C.This case report demonstrates an atypical initial presentation for MIS-C that has not been reported in the literature. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an emerging entity during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.Medium- and large-vessel changes are present in MIS-C; however, microcirculatory impairment has not been documented.We report a case of MIS-C in a toddler that presented with persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and rash.Nailfold videocapillaroscopy was abnormal, suggesting microcirculatory disease in the setting of MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, MIS-A, is a rare but severe post-covid-19 immunologic complication.The presentation is similar to Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C.Both MIS-A/C are life-threatening immunologic syndromes characterized by hypotension, skin rashes, myocardial affection, coagulopathy and GI symptoms.Here we describe a case of MIS-A in a 35-year-old previously healthy female who, five weeks after a mild covid-19 infection, presented with a life-threatening immunological reaction.The patient made a swift recovery upon treatment with immunoglobulins, corticosteroids and an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.We want to highlight the importance of immunological derangements following covid-19 infections in adults.We also present a treatment suggestion for MIS-A based on the management routine for MIS-C, which has been developed from international discussions and collaborations by pediatric rheumatologists in Sweden and around the world. In the early stages of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it was assumed that this infection is very mild and uncommon in children.However, recent reports have shown that children may also develop the disease and its severe complications.These complications included shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and pneumonia in children.A previously healthy 14-month-old boy presented with fever, irritability, and skin rash, besides changes in the lips, conjunctiva, and tongue.His medical history, clinical presentations, treatment, laboratory data, and follow-up information were recorded.He was treated according to the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD).He had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient.However, the result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19 was negative.Immunoglobulin M for COVID-19 was positive (1.20), while immunoglobulin G was negative (0.37).Three weeks later, seroconversion of COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (1.42) occurred.Despite treatment with two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, coronary artery ectasia was detected.On the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient experienced hypotension, which necessitated treatment with inotropic drugs and resulted in a change of diagnosis to MIS-C.The later echocardiography showed evidence of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), which finally changed to giant CAA.Although the patient was treated with infliximab, the size of CAA showed a significant decrease in the one-month follow-up.This is the first report of MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, accompanied by KD, which was complicated with giant CAA. We describe a child with acute fever and abdominal pain who developed rash and edema of extremities.Blood test revealed thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, positive dengue-IgM, and hypoalbuminemia with elevated procalcitonin.Right pleural effusion revealed from chest x-ray.Diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) grade 1, however, at 7th day of illness, altered mental status, respiratory and circulatory failure occurred.Laboratory examination showed marked thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, metabolic acidosis, elevated D-dimer, decrease fibrinogen, and elevated cardiac marker (troponin I and CKMB).The patient then developed catecholamine-resistant shock and did not survive after 48 hours.Although rapid test of SARS CoV-2 infection was negative, rapid deterioration with some unusual clinical feature suggest multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.This case raises an awareness of MIS-C that clinical features resemble dengue infection. Since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the pediatric population has been less affected by the disease both in frequency and severity.However, since April cases of variable presentation and severity characterized by inflammatory phenomena that affect multiple organs have been reported, a condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).The literature has reported frequent cardiac involvement, up to 80%.This is characterized by myocardial injury with a significant increase of biomarkers such as serum troponins I and T, BNP, or NT-ProBNP coupled with varying degrees of ventricular dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, and arrhythmias.Coronary compromise has also been described, which can occur in up to 23% of cases, and ranges from dila tations to aneurysms.Inpatient and outpatient cardiology follow-up has been systematized based on the clinical phenotypes such as myocardial injury (myocarditis, valvulitis, pericarditis), shock (usua lly vasoplegic), Kawasaki disease-type manifestations, and those MIS-C that do not comply with the clinic of the previous three.This last group represents the main challenge in the short-, medium- and long-term follow-up, therefore, it is necessary a multidisciplinary team for managing these patients.Considering the high frequency of cardiac compromise in MIS-C, and the importance of reaching a consensus regarding its management and follow-up, we present these recommendations according to the current state of knowledge regarding this recently described pathology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), also known as COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe resulting in a worldwide pandemic.This disease has such varying presentation within the population.Although rare, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a potentially fatal complication of SARS-CoV2 infection and can be easily missed in the early stages.Because emergency department (ED) providers are often the initial treating providers, knowledge of the clinical manifestations and treatment of MIS-C is essential.The purpose of this article is to present a case of MIS-C in a rural ED, describe the subtle signs of disease, and educate clinicians on this rare and potentially deadly disease. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still striking the global population affecting all age groups.So far, many clinical features associated with COVID-19 illness remain under-identified, especially atypical manifestations.It is essential to characterize associated rare symptoms to better recognize complications.As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) in severe infection manifesting as a generalized inflammatory reaction and immune response in many body systems, potential involvement of the male urogenital tract by SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.Herein, we report a case of a pediatric patient with orchiepididymitis associated with COVID-19 infection, emphasizing the importance of considering other manifestations such as genital involvement of MIS-C in children with COVID-19 and highlighting the need to monitor the genitourinary function after infection.Therefore, andrological consultation is necessary to evaluate fertility as a long-term follow-up, especially as the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function are still to be thoroughly researched. Although data on the incidence and severity of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection showed more significant disease among adults and the elderly, a clinical manifestation characterized by a multisystem inflammatory syndrome was described in children (MIS-C).It was initially thought to be specific to children, but recent reports have shown that it can also occur in adults.MIS-C is characterized by a number of multisystemic manifestations resembling other known previously described illnesses, mainly Kawasaki disease, especially in cases with shock, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.Available literature shows that our knowledge of MIS-C is largely incomplete.Its development in strict relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection seems documented and, in most cases, can be considered a post-infectious manifestation secondary to an abnormal immune response for some aspects, similar to that seen in adults several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection.However, in a minority of cases, a clinical picture with symptoms fulfilling criteria for MIS-C diagnosis develops during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.It is highly likely that the criteria currently used to diagnose MIS-C are too broad, meaning that children with different diseases are included.As clarity on the pathogenesis of MIS-C is lacking, different therapeutic approaches have been used, but no specific therapy is currently available.Further studies are urgently needed to improve our definition of MIS-C, to define the real impact on child health, and to elucidate the best clinical and therapeutic approach and true prognosis. This is a case of an 11-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory failure, requiring intubation while testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.During her recovery, she had new onset fevers and uptrending inflammatory markers.After an evaluation of infectious causes, the diagnosis of MIS-C was made approximately 1 month after her initial symptoms. We report three critically ill pediatric patients (aged 6-10 years), presenting with features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from April 4 to May 10, 2020, to a tertiary-care center in New Jersey, United States.All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were previously healthy.Clinical presentations were similar with fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and/or rash.One patient had altered mental status with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings consistent with aseptic meningitis.Laboratory values were remarkable for high levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin in all patients.All had low albumin levels.Evaluation for other infectious etiologies was negative.All of the patients were critically ill, requiring admission to the intensive care unit.All had circulatory shock and needed inotropes.Two patients had respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support and one had cardiac dysfunction.All patients received steroids, and two received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).One patient received tocilizumab.None of the children died.MIS-C is a recently recognized pediatric illness spectrum in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical characterization is essential for understanding disease mechanisms to inform clinical practice. Following emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a surge in the life-threatening illness now termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has raised questions about the unique effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents.Two important new studies by Consiglio et al.and Gruber et al.have begun to shine light on the immune drivers of this enigmatic disease. Childhood cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the rise as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe.Most children acquire infection from an adult household member.Children may stay asymptomatic, have a pre-symptomatic stage, or present with symptoms (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing being the most common).Nearly one-third of the pediatric cases (32%) in the United States occurred in children age 15 to 17 years.Children are also at risk of a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).The risk of vertical transmission is low (2%) in newborns of mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the gold standard for (SARS-CoV-2).Serology should be considered in a child with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when NAAT is negative and at least 2 weeks have passed since symptom onset and for assessment of MIS-C. Easy fatigability after COVID-19 infection is reported in adults; however, data in children are lacking.Implementation of early and robust containment strategies coupled with universal COVID-19 vaccination are vital to halt the spread.[Pediatr Ann.2021;50(2):e84-e89.]. During the winter months of 2020/2021 a wave of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in Poland.We present the results of a nationwide register aiming to capture and characterise MIS-C with a focus on severity determinants.The first MIS-C wave in Poland was notably high, hence our analysis involved 274 children.The group was 62.8% boys, with a median age of 8.8 years.Besides one Asian, all were White.Overall, the disease course was not as severe as in previous reports, however.Pediatric intensive care treatment was required for merely 23 (8.4%) of children, who were older and exhibited a distinguished clinical picture at hospital admission.We have also identified sex-dependent differences; teenage boys more often had cardiac involvement (decreased ejection fraction in 25.9% vs. 14.7%) and fulfilled macrophage activation syndrome definition (31.0% vs. 15.2%).Among all boys, those hospitalized in pediatric intensive care unit were significantly older (median 11.2 vs. 9.1 years).Henceforth, while ethnicity and sex may affect MIS-C phenotype, management protocols might be not universally applicable, and should rather be adjusted to the specific population. The varied spectrum of presentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is intriguing.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection.A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A).With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19.However, it is not as uncommon as we think.Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity.Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A.Also, there is no clear treatment guideline for MIS-A unlike MIS-C where the treatment protocol is well laid out.Awareness about MIS-A among treating clinicians can thus help in further evaluation and increased identification of the syndrome at the early stages thereby helping in the early institution of treatment.Our tertiary COVID care hospital in South India which has handled about 5200 cases of COVID-19 is been able to identify 04 cases of MIS-A proving that this clinical entity is not as rare as it is thought but lacks reporting and prompt identification.Here we describe 04 cases of MIS-A and strive to bring in the various aspects of it, including the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, diagnostic criteria and treatment considerations in this post second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. A new multisystem inflammatory syndrome apparently related to infection with SARS-CoV-2 has recently been reported in older children (known as MIS-C), manifested by severe abdominal pain, cardiac dysfunction and shock.Here, I discuss the similarities and differences between MIS-C and Kawasaki disease, focusing on their epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiological mechanisms. The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.It included all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)/ Kawasaki disease (KD) like illness, admitted from March to September, 2020 to The Childrens Hospital, Lahore.Out of 66 children, 45 (68.2%) were COVID-19 and 21 (31.8%) MIS-C/KD temporally associated with SARS-C0V-2.The mean age was 7.9 4.2 years.Majority of children had mild to moderate illness 38 (57.6%), while 23 (34.8%) had severe or critical disease.Among all patients, 24 (36.4%) had some underlying comorbidity.Blood group A was significantly associated with severe and critical disease (p=0.030).COVID-19 in children had generally a good outcome, but children with blood group A were more susceptible to severe/critical disease.Key Words: Coronavirus disease 2019, ABO blood groups, Children, Severity, Outcome. In April 2020, data began emerging on Kawasaki-like syndrome and hyperinflammatory response in children with COVID-19.Since then, much has been published on the presentation of COVID-19 in pediatric patients, including its association with Kawasaki disease and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).However, questions still remain regarding the risk factors, pathogenesis, prognosis, and specific therapy for these manifestations of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.It included all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)/ Kawasaki disease (KD) like illness, admitted from March to September, 2020 to The Childrens Hospital, Lahore.Out of 66 children, 45 (68.2%) were COVID-19 and 21 (31.8%) MIS-C/KD temporally associated with SARS-C0V-2.The mean age was 7.9 4.2 years.Majority of children had mild to moderate illness 38 (57.6%), while 23 (34.8%) had severe or critical disease.Among all patients, 24 (36.4%) had some underlying comorbidity.Blood group A was significantly associated with severe and critical disease (p=0.030).COVID-19 in children had generally a good outcome, but children with blood group A were more susceptible to severe/critical disease.Key Words: Coronavirus disease 2019, ABO blood groups, Children, Severity, Outcome. Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults.A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death.The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood.We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission.A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication.Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation.Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C. Recent reports highlight a new clinical syndrome in children related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1-multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)-which comprises multiorgan dysfunction and systemic inflammation2-13.We performed peripheral leukocyte phenotyping in 25 children with MIS-C, in the acute (n = 23; worst illness within 72 h of admission), resolution (n = 14; clinical improvement) and convalescent (n = 10; first outpatient visit) phases of the illness and used samples from seven age-matched healthy controls for comparisons.Among the MIS-C cohort, 17 (68%) children were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, suggesting previous SARS-CoV-2 infections14,15, and these children had more severe disease.In the acute phase of MIS-C, we observed high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, interferon- and differential T and B cell subset lymphopenia.High CD64 expression on neutrophils and monocytes, and high HLA-DR expression on and CD4+CCR7+ T cells in the acute phase, suggested that these immune cell populations were activated.Antigen-presenting cells had low HLA-DR and CD86 expression, potentially indicative of impaired antigen presentation.These features normalized over the resolution and convalescence phases.Overall, MIS-C presents as an immunopathogenic illness1 and appears distinct from Kawasaki disease. COVID-19 is to date a global pandemic that can affect all age groups; gastrointestinal symptoms are quite common in patients with COVID-19 and a new clinical entity defined as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has been described in children and adolescents previously affected by COVID-19.Presenting symptoms of this new disease include high fever and severe abdominal pain that can mimic more common causes of abdominal pain; patients can rapidly deteriorate presenting severe cardiac dysfunction and multiorgan failure.Some fatalities due to this serious illness have been reported.We describe the case of a ten-year-old patient presenting with persistent high fever associated with continuous and worsening abdominal pain.Various hypotheses were performed during his diagnostic workup and an initial appendectomy was performed in the suspect of acute appendicitis.As his clinical picture deteriorated, the child was subsequently diagnosed and successfully treated as a case of MIS-C.The objective of this case report and brief review of abdominal pain in children throughout the age groups is to provide the emergency pediatrician with updated suggestions in diagnosing abdominal pain in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives.Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease.However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions.Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response.Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C.Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality.It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems.Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD. Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a major complication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pediatric patients.Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation.Children with MIS-C present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms.Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in children with SARS-CoV-2.We hypothesize that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of disease.We show that protein signatures demonstrate overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is an important marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA.We find that IFN responses are dysregulated in MIS-C patients, and that IFN levels delineate clinical heterogeneity. We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients.We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site.The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8.The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized.Here, we show that pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) possess higher SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers compared to those with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), likely reflecting a longer time since onset of infection in MIS-C patients. In rare instances, pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a novel immunodysregulation syndrome termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We compared MIS-C immunopathology with severe COVID-19 in adults.MIS-C does not result in pneumocyte damage but is associated with vascular endotheliitis and gastrointestinal epithelial injury.In MIS-C, the cytokine release syndrome is characterized by IFN and not type I interferon.Persistence of patrolling monocytes differentiates MIS-C from severe COVID-19, which is dominated by HLA-DRlo classical monocytes.IFN levels correlate with granzyme B production in CD16+ NK cells and TIM3 expression on CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells.Single-cell TCR profiling reveals a skewed TCR repertoire enriched for TRBV11-2 and a superantigenic signature in TIM3+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells.Using NicheNet, we confirm IFN as a central cytokine in the communication between TIM3+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells, CD16+ NK cells, and patrolling monocytes.Normalization of IFN, loss of TIM3, quiescence of CD16+ NK cells, and contraction of patrolling monocytes upon clinical resolution highlight their potential role in MIS-C immunopathogenesis. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in April 2020 in communities with high COVID-19 rates.This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses.Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection.These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD.We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children.The discovery of monogenic IEIs underlying MIS-C would shed light on its pathogenesis, paving the way for a new genetic approach to classic KD, revisited as a heterogeneous collection of IEIs to viruses. Most children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have mild or minimal disease, with a small proportion developing severe disease or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population.We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients.We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18).As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001).Higher sC5b9 levels were associated with higher serum creatinine (P = .01) but not age.Of the 19 patients for whom complete clinical criteria were available, 17 (89%) met criteria for TMA.A high proportion of tested children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had evidence of complement activation and met clinical and diagnostic criteria for TMA.Future studies are needed to determine if hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for TMA, if TMA-directed management is helpful, and if there are any short- or long-term clinical consequences of complement activation and endothelial damage in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a delayed and severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that strikes previously healthy children.As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions.We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases.We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-, IFN, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes.We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the V21.3 T cell receptor chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected.The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution.V21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro.Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles.Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal V21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health of children worldwide.Although overall mortality from COVID-19 in children remains low, an associated multisystem inflammatory disorder has emerged.The disorder has been recognized and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This comprehensive review describes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, other potential diagnoses, and treatments relevant to MIS-C.The review also includes patient and family education and anticipatory guidance, and discusses nursing implications for nurses working in various roles and settings, including direct care, research, and public health. During 2020, increasing numbers of case reports, case series, and small observational studies reported long-term complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who had recovered from acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Long COVID has a prevalence of between 10-30% in patients with a recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Pulmonary, hematologic, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, and dermatologic involvement, and chronic multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) highlights the requirement for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with long COVID.This Editorial aims to present the current status of long COVID, or post-COVID syndrome, and its global impact on health and the provision of health care. Cardiac manifestations in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can include coronary artery aneurysms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and electrocardiographic disturbances.We report the clinical course of three children with MIS-C while focusing on the unique considerations for managing atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.All initially had normal electrocardiograms but developed bradycardia followed by either PR prolongation or QTc elongation.Two had mild left ventricular ejection fraction dysfunction prior to developing third-degree heart block and/or a junctional escape rhythm; one had moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction that normalized before developing a prolonged QTc.On average, our patients presented to the hospital 4 days after onset of illness.Common presenting symptoms included fevers, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.Inflammatory and coagulation factors were their highest early on, and troponin peaked the highest within the first two days; meanwhile, peak brain-natriuretic peptide occurred at hospital days 3-4.The patients lowest left ventricular ejection fraction occurred at days 5-6 of illness.Initial electrocardiograms were benign with PR intervals below 200 milliseconds (ms); however, collectively the length of time from initial symptom presentation till when electrocardiographic abnormalities began was approximately days 8-9.When comparing the timing of electrocardiogram changes with trends in c-reactive protein and brain-natriuretic peptide, it appeared that the PR and QTc elongation patterns occurred after the initial hyperinflammatory response.This goes in line with the proposed mechanism that such conduction abnormalities occur secondary to inflammation and edema of the conduction tissue as part of a widespread global myocardial injury process.Based on this syndrome being a hyperinflammatory response likely affecting conduction tissue, our group was treated with different regimens of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, anakinra, and/or tocilizumab.These medications were successful in treating third-degree heart block, prolonged QTc, and a junctional ectopic rhythm. Enteritis as the only manifestation of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adolescents without features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or a prior history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been described.We report two adolescent patients (a 14-year-old male and a 20-year-old pregnant female) presenting to tertiary-care centers in the United States with severe enteritis as the only manifestation of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.The patients were hospitalized with acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with no evidence of MIS-C, and were previously healthy with no history of IBD.The patients nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and testing for other infectious etiologies was negative.Both patients received intravenous corticosteroids and recovered without short-term complications.None of the patients died.This report highlights the need for keeping a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents presenting solely with gastrointestinal manifestations, in the absence of respiratory symptoms or multisystem involvement, for prompt recognition and timely management. Although there is still much that is not understood, experience with previous coronavirus outbreaks and available data on COVID-19 indicate a reduced propensity to affect children.Nonetheless, serious complicationsalthough rareare being seen in pediatric patients.This review, written with the emergency medicine clinician in mind, describes the epidemiology, clinical features, and management implications for COVID-19 in pediatric patients.It includes a discussion of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, as well as other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are affecting children and families, such as poisonings, childhood immunizations, mental health, nonaccidental trauma, and neglect. Objectives To characterize the demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, in-hospital treatments, and health outcomes among children/adolescents diagnosed or hospitalized with COVID-19.Secondly, to describe health outcomes amongst children/adolescents diagnosed with previous seasonal influenza.Design International network cohort.Setting Real-world data from European primary care records (France/Germany/Spain), South Korean claims and US claims and hospital databases.Participants Diagnosed and/or hospitalized children/adolescents with COVID-19 at age <18 between January and June 2020; diagnosed with influenza in 2017-2018.Main outcome measures Baseline demographics and comorbidities, symptoms, 30-day in-hospital treatments and outcomes including hospitalization, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and death.Results A total of 55,270 children/adolescents diagnosed and 3,693 hospitalized with COVID-19 and 1,952,693 diagnosed with influenza were studied.Comorbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders, heart disease, and cancer were all more common among those hospitalized vs diagnosed with COVID-19.The most common COVID-19 symptom was fever.Dyspnea, bronchiolitis, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in COVID-19 than influenza.In-hospital treatments for COVID-19 included repurposed medications (<10%), and adjunctive therapies: systemic corticosteroids (6.8% to 37.6%), famotidine (9.0% to 28.1%), and antithrombotics such as aspirin (2.0% to 21.4%), heparin (2.2% to 18.1%), and enoxaparin (2.8% to 14.8%).Hospitalization was observed in 0.3% to 1.3% of the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort, with undetectable (N<5 per database) 30-day fatality.Thirty-day outcomes including pneumonia, ARDS, and MIS-C were more frequent in COVID-19 than influenza.Conclusions Despite negligible fatality, complications including pneumonia, ARDS and MIS-C were more frequent in children/adolescents with COVID-19 than with influenza.Dyspnea, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differential diagnosis.A wide range of medications were used for the inpatient management of pediatric COVID-19. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is recognized as a respiratory illness, which includes pulmonary consolidations, hypoxemic states, and hypercoagulopathic tendencies with a broad clinical severity.Recently, more reports have described post-infection manifestations.These include multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with more than 400 cases published since the start of the coronavirus disease pandemic.In October 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published 27 cases [1] describing the new multi-system inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A).Nine of the cases were reported directly to the CDC, 7 from published case reports and another 11 patients found in three distinct case series. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common findings in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, including vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and difficulty in feeding, although these symptoms tend to be mild.The hepato-biliary system and the pancreas may also be involved, usually with a mild elevation of transaminases and, rarely, pancreatitis.In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis.Gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary manifestations are probably related to a loss in enterocyte absorption capability and microscopic mucosal damage caused by a viral infection of intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes and other cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 receptor resulting in immune cells activation with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines.Specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplantation may pose a risk for the more severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but as adult data accumulate, paediatric data is still limited.The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence about the effect of COVID-19 on the gastrointestinal system in children, with emphasis on the emerging MIS-C and specific considerations such as patients with IBD and liver transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be one of the most common presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, later named COVID-19.The symptoms such as nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea may be recognised as either a finding of COVID-19 or prominent presentation of multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).COVID-19 may present with acute appendicitis and/or may mimic its clinical findings.Although, coexistence of acute appendicitis and COVID-19 has been well documented, it is not clear whether appendicitis is a complication of COVID-19 or coincidence in children.A 13-year-old boy who developed acute appendicitis during the clinical course of COVID-19 is presented to discuss the possibility of causal relationship between appendicitis and COVID-19 in children. Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults.A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death.The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood.We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission.A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication.Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation.Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C. Clinical features of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 are nonspecific.In this retrospective cohort study of 39 patients evaluated for MIS-C, 11 had non-SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3 of whom were also diagnosed with MIS-C. Clinical features were similar in patients with MIS-C and patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections.Clinicians should consider non-SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients undergoing MIS-C evaluation. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected children and adolescents throughout the world since its discovery in 2019.For many children, infection with SARS-CoV-2 presents as an asymptomatic to mild infection.However, in a small subset of children who become infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a more severe post-infectious inflammatory illness has emerged, referred to as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).Since its discovery in 2020, the scientific community has learned a lot about the presentation, evaluation, treatment, and management of MIS-C. Emerging reports show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection precedes the appearance of various autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, including paediatric inflammatory multisystemic syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), thus adding to the growing mystery of this virus and raising questions about the nature of its link with autoimmune and autoinflammatory sequelae. Hyponatraemia is frequently encountered in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with poor prognosis.This review aims to describe for the first time the prevalence, aetiology, prognostic value, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatraemia in children and adolescents with COVID-19, taking into account all relevant studies published in PubMed and Cochrane Library studies until 26th September 2021.Literature search did not detect any studies evaluating the prevalence and prognostic value of sodium disorders in paediatric patients with COVID-19.A broader literature review showed a high prevalence of hyponatraemia in children with bacterial pneumonia, while some studies have reported that hyponatraemia is relatively common in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).In adults with COVID-19, an inverse association between sodium and interleukin-6 levels has been found, indicating that hyponatraemia could be used as a surrogate marker for the risk of cytokine storm and may facilitate the identification of patients who could benefit from immunomodulatory agents.Studies are urgently needed to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of electrolyte abnormalities in children with COVID-19.In the meantime, clinicians are urged to consider hyponatraemia in children with COVID-19 as a potential red flag, investigate the cause and administer fluids and other therapies accordingly. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is an ongoing public health emergency, with over 4 million confirmed cases worldwide.Due to the novel nature of this coronavirus and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology, there is continued uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and management of COVID-19, especially in pediatric patients.In addition, a new febrile hyperinflammatory Kawasaki-like syndrome (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C) has emerged in pediatric patients with temporal association to COVID-19 infection.This review article aims to provide an up-to-date review of the clinical and imaging findings of pediatric MIS-C associated with COVID-19, compared with typical acute pediatric COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on thoracic imaging findings.Supplemental material is available for this article.RSNA, 2020. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in March 2020, affecting millions of people worldwide.However, COVID-19 in pediatric patients represents 1-5% of all cases, and the risk for developing severe disease and critical illness is much lower in children with COVID-19 than in adults.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a possible complication of COVID-19, has been described as a hyperinflammatory condition with multiorgan involvement similar to that in Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome in children with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.This review presents an update on the diagnostic methods for COVID-19, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, serology tests, and imaging, and summarizes the current recommendations for the management of the disease.Particular emphasis is placed on respiratory support, which includes noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation strategies according to lung compliance and pattern of lung injury.Pharmacological treatment, including pathogen-targeted drugs and host-directed therapies, has been addressed.The diagnostic criteria and management of MIS-C are also summarized. The novel human coronavirus of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly swept throughout the entire world.As the ongoing pandemic has spread, recent studies have described children presenting with a multisystem inflammatory disorder sharing the features of Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome, now named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).These cases report a similar phenotype of prolonged fever, multisystem involvement, and biomarkers demonstrating marked hyperinflammation that occurs temporally in association with local community spread of SARS-CoV-2.Herein, we describe the presentation, clinical characteristics, and management of an 11-year-old boy with prolonged fever, strikingly elevated inflammatory markers, and profound, early coronary artery aneurysm consistent with a hyperinflammatory, multisystem disease temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019.We highlight our multidisciplinary teams management with intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, as a strategy to manage this multisystem, hyperinflammatory disease process. We report a case of a 15-year-old female presenting with a serious multisystemic inflammatory illness during a surge of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases in our county.The initial clinical findings of sore throat and neck stiffness, followed by signs of sepsis, raised suspicion of Lemierre syndrome early in her hospital course.However, the presence of severe respiratory distress, multifocal pneumonia with pleural effusion on chest radiograph, acute kidney injury, and the discovery of coronary artery ectasia, pointed to the new entity "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)."Immune modulatory treatment was thus considered.However, progressive neck pain and swelling, coupled with the eventual growth of Fusobacterium necrophorum on blood culture, eventually led to the correct diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome. Since December 2019, Covid-19 has become a challenge for doctors around the world, including pediatricians.In most infected children, the disease manifests itself in a mild or is char- acterized by a subclinical course.At the same time, in some cases, a severe clinical picture of the so-called late Covid disease may develop, in the form of a multisystem syndrome and other complications.In 2020-2021 at the Academic Pediatric Clinic named after G. Zhvania of Tbilisi State Medical University, we observed 60 children with post-Covid complications and late Covid syn- drome.More than half (32 children - 53.3%) were under 5 years of age, with a predominance of boys (33 children - 55%) who had a Covid-19 infection 1.5-2 months before contacting us with a positive antibody reaction.Most of them (51 children - 85%) were healthy before the disease.Vasculopathy, immune thrombocytopenia, thalassemia minor, primary diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, pneumonia-atelectasis, exacerbation of the underlying disease - arthralgia, arthritis and abnormal manifestations of sleep disturbance, general weakness and dizziness were noted.Separately, it is necessary to highlight the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in chirdren - MIS-C (8 children - 13%) proceeding with clinical signs of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous-lymphatic syndrome) with hectic temperature, polyserositis, hepatosplenomegaly, high rates of inflammation markers, a tendency to hypercoagulability.One patient had a coronary artery aneurysm.In 3 cases, the ANA and ANF titer was increased (up to 1:640) and also with nucleic, cytoplasmic and linear fibrils fluorescence, which indicates immune reactions in Covid infection, which can explain the positive effect of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of these patients.Only 22 (36%) patients were hospitalized, the rest were observed on an outpatient basis.Based on the aforementioned, it can be concluded that even with the asymptomatic course of Covidinfection in children, complications can be observed and the syndrome of the so-called late Covid, which dictates the need for a thorough examination of these patients and observation in dynamics. The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020.This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities.In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death.SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a "cytokine storm" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications.The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days.It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding.This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum.This article gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation and laboratory tests of COVID-19 and correlating with the current understanding of the pathological basis of this disease in the paediatric population. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV2) infection is a rapid evolving pandemic with multiple peaks of outbreak and substantial mortality worldwide.It has been proposed that infants are more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection.On the other hand, children with COVID-19 have generally milder disease compared to infected adults and more often presented with gastrointestinal symptoms compared to respiratory ones.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c) is an ominous demonstration of COVID-19 with cardiac involvement and mortality rate <2%.From cardiovascular point of view, wide spectrum of manifestations including subclinical myocardial injury, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombus formation in cardiac chambers and vascular bed has been reported in COVID-19 disease.Congenital heart disease (CHD), assumed as the most prevalent form of congenital disease.Advances in medical and surgical treatments for CHD have led to more alive patients with underlying heart disease secondary to congenital defects.These group of pediatric patients are prone to heart failure, arrhythmia and embolic events.In this narrative review, we intended to evaluate the cardiovascular and pediatric presentations of COVID-19 as well as the manifestation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pediatric patients with CHD. The disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild and self-limiting in previously healthy children, but they may also develop severe disease.Severe COVID-19 infection is especially observed in very young children or those with underlying comorbidities.Moreover, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome that mimics the Kawasaki disease shock syndrome can develop in children that are genetically predisposed to displaying an overactive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.In this review, we describe the clinical phenotypes of mild and severe COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We also discuss the possible immunobiological mechanisms that may be involved in the protection of children against COVID-19 and the development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Primary intracranial hypertension (PIH) is characterized by clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, elevated opening pressure, and absence of mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or meningeal enhancement on neuroimaging.Visual changes are a common presenting feature and if untreated there is risk of irreversible vision loss.There have been recent proposed changes to the criteria for PIH along with studies looking at the differences in imaging characteristics between adult and pediatric PIH.The presence of transverse sinus stenosis alone was highly sensitive and specific for pediatric PIH.The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial was an adult, multicenter study that examined the use of acetazolamide and weight loss on the course of PIH.The study confirmed many previously held beliefs including the most common presenting symptom in PIH is headache.Most patients present with bilateral papilledema with 58.2% of patients having symmetric Frisen scale grading and within one grade in 92.8%.Although diplopia is a common reported symptom, very few have evidence of cranial nerve palsy.Male gender, high-grade papilledema, and decreased visual acuity at presentation are risk factors for treatment failure.Acetazolamide use is associated with mild metabolic acidosis.During acetazolamide treatment, monitoring for hypokalemia or aplastic anemia is not recommended.Monitoring transaminases in the titration phase of treatment should be considered due to a case of transaminitis and pancreatitis with elevated lipase.Newer case reports have also seen associations of secondary intracranial hypertension with concurrent COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Children are seldom affected by severe forms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection; however, the impact of comorbidities in the clinical presentation and outcome of SARS-CoV2 in children is poorly characterized including that of chronic liver disease (CLD) and those taking immunosuppressive medications for autoimmune liver disease or following liver transplantation (LT).Although not the main target organ, a spectrum of liver involvement has been described in children infected with SARS-CoV2 and those presenting with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).The Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the Society of Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) present an evidence-based position paper on liver involvement in children with SARS-CoV2 infection and its impact on those with CLD as well as LT recipients.All children may exhibit acute liver injury from SARS-CoV2 infection, and those with CLD and may experience hepatic decompensation.Preventative and therapeutic measures are discussed. With growing number of pediatric cases of COVID-19, a unique hyper-inflammatory syndrome, linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged in children referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).This Kawasaki Disease (KD)-like illness has been described across the world.This syndrome shares features of KD, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome and is associated with significantly elevated inflammatory markers.Everyday there are new data emerging improving the care of these patients.The Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (ACTION) is a collaborative network designed to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure and involves centers from across North America.The committee gathered information concerning COVID-19 anticoagulation practices at various centers and harmonized the data to formulate a set of recommendations. During June 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States.U.S. pediatric COVID-19-related hospitalizations increased during July-August 2021 following emergence of the Delta variant and peaked in September 2021.As of May 12, 2021, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccinations for persons aged 12 years, and on November 2, 2021, COVID-19 vaccinations were recommended for persons aged 5-11 years.** To date, clinical signs and symptoms, illness course, and factors contributing to hospitalizations during the period of Delta predominance have not been well described in pediatric patients.CDC partnered with six childrens hospitals to review medical record data for patients aged <18 years with COVID-19-related hospitalizations during July-August 2021.Among 915 patients identified, 713 (77.9%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 (acute COVID-19 as the primary or contributing reason for hospitalization), 177 (19.3%) had incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (asymptomatic or mild infection unrelated to the reason for hospitalization), and 25 (2.7%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19.Among the 713 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24.7% were aged <1 year, 17.1% were aged 1-4 years, 20.1% were aged 5-11 years, and 38.1% were aged 12-17 years.Approximately two thirds of patients (67.5%) had one or more underlying medical conditions, with obesity being the most common (32.4%); among patients aged 12-17 years, 61.4% had obesity.Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 15.8% had a viral coinfection (66.4% of whom had respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection).Approximately one third (33.9%) of patients aged <5 years hospitalized for COVID-19 had a viral coinfection.Among 272 vaccine-eligible (aged 12-17 years) patients hospitalized for COVID-19, one (0.4%) was fully vaccinated.*** Approximately one half (54.0%) of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 received oxygen support, 29.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 1.5% died; of those requiring respiratory support, 14.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Among pediatric patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations, many had severe illness and viral coinfections, and few vaccine-eligible patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were vaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccination for those aged 5 years and other prevention strategies to protect children and adolescents from COVID-19, particularly those with underlying medical conditions. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age1,2.Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)3-5.Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein.Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a recently identified syndrome that appears to be temporally associated with novel coronavirus 2019 infection.MIS-C presents with fever and evidence of systemic inflammation, which can manifest as cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, and gastrointestinal (GI) system dysfunction.Presenting GI symptoms are seen in the majority, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.Any segment of the GI tract may be affected; however, inflammation in the ileum and colon predominates.Progressive bowel wall thickening can lead to luminal narrowing and obstruction.Most will have resolution of intestinal inflammation with medical therapies; however, in rare instances, surgical resection may be required. During the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reports of a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been increasing in Europe and the United States (1-3).Clinical features in children have varied but predominantly include shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 (1).Since June 2020, several case reports have described a similar syndrome in adults; this review describes in detail nine patients reported to CDC, seven from published case reports, and summarizes the findings in 11 patients described in three case series in peer-reviewed journals (4-6).These 27 patients had cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms without severe respiratory illness and concurrently received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody assays indicating recent infection.Reports of these patients highlight the recognition of an illness referred to here as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, and the role for antibody testing in identifying similar cases among adults.Clinicians and health departments should consider MIS-A in adults with compatible signs and symptoms.These patients might not have positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test results, and antibody testing might be needed to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.Because of the temporal association between MIS-A and SARS-CoV-2 infections, interventions that prevent COVID-19 might prevent MIS-A.Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) presents with fever, inflammation and pathology of multiple organs in individuals under 21 years of age in the weeks following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Although an autoimmune pathogenesis has been proposed, the genes, pathways and cell types causal to this new disease remain unknown.Here we perform RNA sequencing of blood from patients with MIS-C and controls to find disease-associated genes clustered in a co-expression module annotated to CD56dimCD57+ natural killer (NK) cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells.A similar transcriptome signature is replicated in an independent cohort of Kawasaki disease (KD), the related condition after which MIS-C was initially named.Probing a probabilistic causal network previously constructed from over 1,000 blood transcriptomes both validates the structure of this module and reveals nine key regulators, including TBX21, a central coordinator of exhausted CD8+ T cell differentiation.Together, this unbiased, transcriptome-wide survey implicates downregulation of NK cells and cytotoxic T cell exhaustion in the pathogenesis of MIS-C. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, particularly in middle- and low-income countries.While this impact has been well-recognized in certain age groups, the effects, both direct and indirect, on the neonatal population remain largely unknown.There are placental changes associated, though the contributions to maternal and fetal illness have not been fully determined.The rate of premature delivery has increased and SARS-CoV-2 infection is proportionately higher in premature neonates, which appears to be related to premature delivery for maternal reasons rather than an increase in spontaneous preterm labor.There is much room for expansion, including long-term data on outcomes for affected babies.Though uncommon, there has been evidence of adverse events in neonates, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C).There are recommendations for reduction of viral transmission to neonates, though more research is required to determine the role of passive immunization of the fetus via maternal vaccination.There is now considerable evidence suggesting that the severe visitation restrictions implemented early in the pandemic have negatively impacted the care of the neonate and the experiences of both parents and healthcare professionals alike.Ongoing collaboration is required to determine the full impact, and guidelines for future management.IMPACT: Comprehensive review of current available evidence related to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neonates, effects on their health, impact on their quality of care and indirect influences on their clinical course, including comparisons with other age groups.Reference to current evidence for maternal experience of infection and how it impacts the fetus and then neonate.Outline of the need for ongoing research, including specific areas in which there are significant gaps in knowledge. This narrative review summarizes the main aspects underlying the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, its epidemiology, pathophysiology, pointing to differences of SARS-CoV-2 main receptors ACE2, in terms of expression and the amount of soluble ACE2 in the circulation of children, men and women, and also in those with risk factors such as the smokers and pregnant women or presenting with comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, renal and CNS pre-existing diseases).Clinical manifestations in adults and children were also described, emphasizing the particularities already seen in children, regarding signs, symptoms, viral excretion time and the involvement of all organs and systems.The COVID-19 in the pediatric population was divided into two sections: one dedicated to previously healthy children and adolescents with COVID-19, and the other to those who live with comorbidities and acquired COVID-19.A few paragraphs were reserved to the recently described severe multisystemic inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) that shares certain characteristics with Kawasaki disease.Some studies on the infection in pregnant and postpartum women, as well as neonates were shown.This review has also covered the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, passing through the imaging diagnosis made by the chest tomography revealing ground glass patching opacities, and results of non-specific exams such as the total blood with lymphopenia, the coagulation tests with increased prothrombin times, as well as marked increments of the D-dimer, troponin and proinflammatory cytokines.In the section devoted to the specific laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, the most used RT-PCR protocols were described and some studies on the serological diagnosis with IgA, IgM and IgG detection were detailed, including the use of rapid immunochromatographic assays and discussing the ideal period after the onset of symptoms to perform each type of test.In the end, the management of pediatric patients with COVID-19 based mainly on supportive measures has been briefly commented. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread relentlessly, associated with a high frequency of respiratory failure and mortality.Children experience largely asymptomatic disease, with rare reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Identifying immune mechanisms that result in these disparate clinical phenotypes in children could provide critical insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis.Using systems serology, in this study we observed in 25 children with acute mild COVID-19 a functional phagocyte and complement-activating IgG response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the acute responses generated in adults with mild disease.Conversely, IgA and neutrophil responses were significantly expanded in adults with severe disease.Moreover, weeks after the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children who develop MIS-C maintained highly inflammatory monocyte-activating SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, distinguishable from acute disease in children but with antibody levels similar to those in convalescent adults.Collectively, these data provide unique insights into the potential mechanisms of IgG and IgA that might underlie differential disease severity as well as unexpected complications in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Introduction Children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), also known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), present with abdominal pain amongst other non-specific symptoms.Whilst initial imaging features of PIMS-TS have been reported, the duration of sonographic features remain unknown.Purpose To describe the abdominal ultrasound features of PIMS-TS at initial presentation and follow-up.Materials and Methods A retrospective review of children presenting with clinical features suspicious for PIMS-TS between April 2020 and June 2021 was carried out.Ultrasound features were documented and reviewed on initial presentation and follow up.Descriptive statistics were used and interobserver variability calculated.Results Of 140 children presenting with suspected PIMS-TS, 120 had confirmed PIMS-TS (median 9 years, interquartile range 7-12 years, 65 male) and 102 underwent abdominal ultrasound (US) at presentation.PIMS-TS was present as a single pathology in 109/120 (91%) and abdominal symptoms were present in 104/109 (95%).US examinations were abnormal in 86/102 (84%), with ascites being the most common abnormality in 65/102 children (64%, 95% CI: 54, 73%).Bowel wall thickening was present in 14/102 (14%, 95% CI: 7, 20%) children and mesenteric inflammation in 16/102 (16%, 95% CI: 9, 23%), all of whom presented with abdominal symptoms.Of these, the distal and terminal ileum were most involved (8/14, 57%).Abdominal symptoms decreased to 7/56 (13%) in children followed up at 6 months.Thirty-eight children had follow-up ultrasound and the presence of bowel inflammation had decreased to 3/27 (11%, 95% CI: -1, 23%) in the less than 2 months group and 0/17 (0%) in the greater than 2-month follow-up group.Conclusion 14% of children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) had abdominal ultrasound findings of bowel inflammation and 16% had mesenteric oedema.All ultrasound abnormalities resolved after 2 months. This is an updated guideline from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) for the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The great majority of COVID-19 patients (>90%) requiring ECMO have been supported using venovenous (V-V) ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups.However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing.Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19-related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented.Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval.There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients.Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard.We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of ECMO for COVID-19. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has (as of Oct. 14, 2020) infected approximately 38 million people worldwide.The most feared sequelae of COVID-19 in adults are severe, often fatal, lung disease, venous thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and multiple organ system failure.Fortunately, unlike adults, most children who contract COVID-19 have a mild respiratory illness or asymptomatic.It is now evident that a small percentage of children develop a critical and novel illness with persistent fever , prominent GI symptoms , single or multi-organ dysfunction including shock and laboratory evidence of profound inflammation which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the CDC.Some of the reported cases share features with well-known inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and toxic shock syndrome.The temporal relationship of MIS-C and COVID-19 suggests a post-infectious immune dysregulation.Patients with MIS-C, especially those with cardiac dysfunction and/or shock, should preferably be managed in pediatric intensive care.We will discuss the epidemiology of MIS-C, similarities with known inflammatory syndromes in children, clinical presentation, and present management options.
