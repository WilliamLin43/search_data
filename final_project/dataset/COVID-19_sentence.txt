Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3).In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive.The performance of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4).The reported test positive percentage agreement between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing.Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting.Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR.Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively.Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment. RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA still represents the method of reference to diagnose and monitor COVID-19.From the onset of the pandemic, however, doubts have been expressed concerning the sensitivity of this molecular diagnosis method.Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a third-generation PCR technique that is particularly adapted to detecting low-abundance targets.We developed two-color ddPCR assays for the detection of four different regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including non-structural (IP4-RdRP, helicase) and structural (E, N) protein-encoding sequences.We observed that N or E subgenomic RNAs are generally more abundant than IP4 and helicase RNA sequences in cells infected in vitro, suggesting that detection of the N gene, coding for the most abundant subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, increases the sensitivity of detection during the highly replicative phase of infection.We investigated 208 nasopharyngeal swabs sampled in March-April 2020 in different hospitals of Greater Paris.We found that 8.6% of informative samples (n = 16/185, P < 0.0001) initially scored as "non-positive" (undetermined or negative) by RT-qPCR were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ddPCR.Our work confirms that the use of ddPCR modestly, but significantly, increases the proportion of upper airway samples testing positive in the framework of first-line diagnosis of a French population. The use of RT-LAMP (reverse transcriptase-loop mediated isothermal amplification) has been considered as a promising point-of-care method to diagnose COVID-19.In this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR.We also demonstrated that this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without any viral infection.Although the majority of manuscripts recently published using this technique describe only the presence of two-color states (pink = negative and yellow = positive), we verified by naked-eye and absorbance measurements that there is an evident third color cluster (orange), in general related to positive samples with low viral loads, but which cannot be defined as positive or negative by the naked eye.Orange colors should be repeated or tested by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic.RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test.All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 C. The use of reaction time longer than 30 min is also not recommended since nonspecific amplifications may cause false positives. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has a genome made of RNA (a nucleic acid similar to DNA) that can mutate, potentially making the disease more transmissible, and more lethal.Most countries have monitored the rise of mutated strains using a technique called next generation sequencing (NGS), which is time-consuming, expensive and requires skilled personnel.Sometimes the mutations to the virus are so small that they can only be detected using NGS.Finding cheaper, simpler and faster SARS-CoV-2 tests that can reliably detect mutated forms of the virus is crucial for public health authorities to monitor and manage the spread of the virus.Lateral flow tests (the same technology used in many pregnancy tests) are typically cheap, fast and simple to use.Typically, lateral flow assay strips have a band of immobilised antibodies that bind to a specific protein (or antigen).If a sample contains antigen molecules, these will bind to the immobilised antibodies, causing a chemical reaction that changes the colour of the strip and giving a positive result.However, lateral flow tests that use antibodies cannot easily detect nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, let alone mutations in them.To overcome this limitation, lateral flow assays can be used to detect a protein called Cas9, which, in turn, is able to bind to nucleic acids with specific sequences.Small changes in the target sequence change how well Cas9 binds to it, meaning that, in theory, this approach could be used to detect small mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Kumar et al.made a lateral flow test that could detect a Cas9 protein that binds to a nucleic acid sequence found in a specific mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2.This Cas9 was highly sensitive to changes in its target sequence, so a small mutation in the target nucleic acid led to the protein binding less strongly, and the signal from the lateral flow test being lost.This meant that the lateral flow test designed by Kumar et al.could detect mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus at a fraction of the price of NGS approaches if used only for diagnosis.The lateral flow test was capable of detecting mutant viruses in patient samples too, generating a colour signal within an hour of a positive sample being run through the assay.The test developed by Kumar et al.could offer public health authorities a quick and cheap method to monitor the spread of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains; as well as a way to determine vaccine efficacy against new strains. Serological testing is emerging as a powerful tool to progress our understanding of COVID-19 exposure, transmission and immune response.Large-scale testing is limited by the need for in-person blood collection by staff trained in venepuncture, and the limited sensitivity of lateral flow tests.Capillary blood self-sampling and postage to laboratories for analysis could provide a reliable alternative.Two-hundred and nine matched venous and capillary blood samples were obtained from thirty nine participants and analysed using a COVID-19 IgG ELISA to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Thirty eight out of thirty nine participants were able to self-collect an adequate sample of capillary blood ( 50 l).Using plasma from venous blood collected in lithium heparin as the reference standard, matched capillary blood samples, collected in lithium heparin-treated tubes and on filter paper as dried blood spots, achieved a Cohens kappa coefficient of > 0.88 (near-perfect agreement, 95% CI 0.738-1.000).Storage of capillary blood at room temperature for up to 7 days post sampling did not affect concordance.Our results indicate that capillary blood self-sampling is a reliable and feasible alternative to venepuncture for serological assessment in COVID-19. Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019, researchers have raced to understand its pathogenesis and begun devising vaccine and treatment strategies.An accurate understanding of the bodys temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring.To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow.Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses.We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO.By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels.Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients.Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO.Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection. Emergence of novel coronavirus-2019 has become an international health concern.The objective of this review is to focus on 2019-nCoV emergence, prophylaxis and to predict the treatment approaches.The first case of 2019-nCoV was noted in Wuhan, China.The WHO has announced this epidemic as pandemic.The 2019-nCoV has +ve ssRNA (29903bp), lipid-bilayer envelope spiked with glycoprotein and bears genome sequences similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13.Antiviral agents like Interferon, Darunavir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Camostat mesylate may be considered for clinical trials.Chinese herbals may be effective against 2019-nCoV.These include Saikosaponins (triterpene glycosides), Amentoflavone, Scutellarein, Myricetin, extracts of Isatis indigotica, and Houttuynia cordata.Another treatment approach is to administer plasma from COVID-19 recovered patients.RNA vaccines, recombinant vector based vaccine and ACE-2 receptor like molecules may be employed for immunization against COVID-19.Moreover, immunity can be boosted against 2019-nCoV by regular exercise.We have checked Thymoquinone as ligand for various targets of 2019-nCoV (receptor binding domain of spike, RNA polymerase, protease, Nsp9 RNA binding protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, endoribonuclease) by protein-ligand docking server SwissDoc.Thymoquinone can bind effectively to the targets of 2019-nCoV.Hence, it may be an effective candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool, sometimes well after their respiratory infection has cleared.This may be significant for patient health, epidemiology, and diagnosis.However, methods to preserve stool, and to extract and quantify viral RNA are not standardized.We test the performance of three preservative approaches at yielding detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the OMNIgene-GUT kit, Zymo DNA/RNA shield kit, and the most commonly applied, storage without preservative.We test these in combination with three extraction kits: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Zymo Quick-RNA Viral Kit, and MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Kit.We also test the utility of ddPCR and RT-qPCR for the reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool.We identify that the Zymo DNA/RNA preservative and the QiaAMP extraction kit yield more detectable RNA than the others, using both ddPCR and RT-qPCR.Taken together, we recommend a comprehensive methodology for preservation, extraction and detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in stool. We examined the usefulness of five COVID-19 antibody detection tests using 114 serum samples at various time points from 34 Japanese COVID-19 patients.We examined Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 from Roche, and four immunochromatography tests from Hangzhou Laihe Biotech, Artron Laboratories, Chil, and Nadal.In the first week after onset, Elecsys had 40% positivity in Group S (severe cases) but was negative in Group M (mild-moderate cases).The immunochromatography kits showed 40-60% and 0-8% positivity in Groups S and M, respectively.In the second week, Elecsys showed 75% and 50% positivity, and the immunochromatography tests showed 5-80% and 50-75% positivity in Groups S and M, respectively.After the third week, Elecsys showed 100% positivity in both groups.The immunochromatography kits showed 100% positivity in Group S. In Group M, positivity decreased to 50% for Chil and 75-89% for Artron and Lyher.Elecsys and immunochromatography kits had 91-100% specificity.Elecsys had comparable chronological change of cut-off index values in the two groups from the second week to the sixth week.The current SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection tests do not provide meaningful interpretation of severity and infection status.Its use might be limited to short-term epidemiological studies. Patients on dialysis are at high risk for death due to COVID-19, yet a significant proportion do survive as evidenced by presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 8% of patients in the U.S. in July 2020.It is unclear whether patients with seropositivity represent the subgroup with robust health status, who would be more likely to mount a durable antibody response.Using data from a July 2020 sample of 28,503 patients receiving dialysis, we evaluated the cross-sectional association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with laboratory surrogates of patient health.In separate logistic regression models, we assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with seven laboratory-based covariates (albumin, creatinine, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone), across the entire range of the laboratory and in comparison to a referent value.Models accounted for age, sex, region, race and ethnicity, and county-level COVID-19 deaths per 100,000.Odds of seropositivity for albumin 3 and 3.5 g/dL were 2.1 (95% CI 1.9-2.3) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 4 g/dL.Odds of seropositivity for serum creatinine 5 and 8 mg/dL were 1.8 (1.6-2.0) and 1.3 (1.2-1.4) respectively, compared with 12.5 mg/dL.Lower values of hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone were associated with higher odds of seropositivity.Laboratory values associated with poorer health status and higher risk for mortality were also associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis. To safely re-open economies and prevent future outbreaks, rapid, frequent, point-of-need, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing is necessary.However, existing field-deployable COVID-19 testing methods require the use of uncomfortable swabs and trained providers in PPE, while saliva-based methods must be transported to high complexity laboratories for testing.Here, we report the development and clinical validation of High-Performance Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (HP-LAMP), a rapid, saliva-based, SARS-CoV-2 test with a limit of detection of 1.4 copies of virus per l of saliva and a sensitivity and specificity with clinical samples of > 96%, on par with traditional RT-PCR based methods using swabs, but can deliver results using only a single fluid transfer step and simple heat block.Testing of 120 patient samples in 40 pools comprised of 5 patient samples each with either all negative or a single positive patient sample was 100% accurate.Thus, HP-LAMP may enable rapid and accurate results in the field using saliva, without need of a high-complexity laboratory. Re-opening of communities in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has ignited new waves of infections in many places around the world.Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods.This study evaluates several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods.First, isopropanol precipitation is shown to provide an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples.Second, direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCRs is evaluated without an RNA extraction step.A simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition is validated using contrived swab samples.Third, an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR is described that permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples with a limit of detection of approximately 50 RNA copies per reaction.Quantification cycle (Cq) values for purified RNA from 30 known positive clinical samples showed a strong correlation (r2 = 0.98) between this homemade master mix and commercial TaqPath master mix.Lastly, end-point fluorescence imaging is found to provide an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler.Adoption of these simple, open-source methods has the potential to reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has proved to be one of the most challenging infectious diseases in the modern era, and despite several countermeasures to lessen its impact, the spread of the virus is still affecting most countries.This renders the goal of active immunization of the population through vaccination a worldwide public health priority.In fact, only when efficient vaccination programs will be successfully implemented, a return to pre-pandemic normality can be considered.The scientific community has made a tremendous effort to blow the lid off the pathogenesis of the disease, and unprecedented efforts are ongoing with governments, private organizations, and academics working together to expeditiously develop safe and efficacious vaccines.Previous research efforts in the development of vaccines for other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) as well other emerging viruses have opened the door for exploiting several strategies to design a new vaccine against the pandemic virus.Indeed, in a few months, a stunning number of vaccines have been proposed, and almost 50 putative vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials.The different vaccine candidates use different vaccine development platforms, from inactivated whole virus vaccine to subunit vaccine, nucleic acid, and vectored vaccines.In this review, we describe strengths, flaws, and potential pitfalls of each approach to understand their chances of success. Universities open for in-person instruction during the 2020-21 academic year implemented a range of prevention strategies to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including physical distancing, mask use, vaccination, contact tracing, case investigation, and quarantine protocols (1).However, in some academic programs, such as health-related programs, aviation, and kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) education, maintaining physical distance while still providing instruction is difficult; for universities with such programs, a single confirmed case of COVID-19 could result in a large number of students, staff members, and instructors being designated close contacts and requiring quarantine if they are not fully vaccinated, even if masks were worn when contact occurred.In January 2021, the St. Louis City Health Department allowed Saint Louis University (SLU) to implement a modified quarantine protocol that considered mask use when determining which close contacts required quarantine.* To assess the impact of the protocol, SLU assessed positive SARS-CoV-2 test result rates by masking status of the persons with COVID-19 and their close contacts.During January-May 2021, 265 students received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; these students named 378 close contacts.Compared with close contacts whose exposure only occurred when both persons were masked (7.7%), close contacts with any unmasked exposure (32.4%) had higher adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (aOR = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-31.1).Any additional exposures were associated with a 40.0% increase in odds of a positive test result (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-1.6).These findings reinforce that universal masking and having fewer encounters in close contact with persons with COVID-19 prevents the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a university setting.Universities opening for in-person instruction could consider taking mask use into account when determining which unvaccinated close contacts require quarantine if enforced testing protocols are in place.However, this study was conducted before the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant became the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, which could have affected these findings given that the Delta variant has been found to be associated with increased transmissibility compared to previous variants. New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are available to prevent the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.We compared the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic and severe disease in the adult population and to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 among the elderly.Leading medical databases were searched until August 30, 2021.Published phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated efficacy of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic and sever COVID-19 in adults were included.Two reviewers independently evaluated the literature search results and independently extracted summary data.The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) according to PRISMA-NMA 2015 to pool indirect comparisons between different vaccines regarding their relative efficacy.The primary outcomes were the efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 in adults (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021235364).Above 200,000 adult participants from eight phase 3 RCTs were included in NMA, of whom 52% received the intervention (active COVID-19 vaccine).While each of nine vaccines was tested in the unique clinical trial as compared to control, based on indirect comparison, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were ranked with the highest probability of efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 (P-scores 0.952 and 0.843, respectively), followed by Gam-COVID-Vac (P-score 0.782), NVX-CoV23730 (P-score 0.700), CoronaVac (P-score 0.570), BN02 (P-score 0.428), WIV04 (P-score 0.327), and Ad26.COV2.S (P-score 0.198).No statistically significant difference was seen in the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic disease in the elderly population.No vaccine was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk for severe COVID-19 than other vaccines, although mRNA-1273 and Gam-COVID-Vac have the highest P-scores (0.899 and 0.816, respectively), indicating greater protection against severe disease than other vaccines.In our indirect comparison, the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, which use mRNA technology, were associated with the highest efficacy to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 compared to other vaccines.This finding may have importance when deciding which vaccine to use, together with other important factors as availability of the vaccines, costs, logistics, side effects, and patient acceptability. Widespread high-throughput testing for identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by RT-PCR has been a foundation in the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Quality assurance metrics for these RT-PCR tests are still evolving as testing is widely implemented.As testing increases, it is important to understand performance characteristics and the errors associated with these tests.Herein, we investigate a high-throughput, laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay to determine whether modeling can generate quality control metrics that identify false-positive (FP) results due to contamination.This study reviewed repeated clinical samples focusing on positive samples that test negative on re-extraction and PCR, likely representing false positives.To identify and predict false-positive samples, we constructed machine learning-derived models based on the extraction method used.These models identified variables associated with false-positive results across all methods, with sensitivities for predicting FP results ranging between 67% and 100%.Application of the models to all results predicted a total FP rate of 0.08% across all samples, or 2.3% of positive results, similar to reports for other RT-PCR tests for RNA viruses.These models can predict quality control parameters, enabling laboratories to generate decision trees that reduce interpretation errors, allow for automated reflex testing of samples with a high FP probability, improve workflow efficiency, and increase diagnostic accuracy for patient care. In this COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cost-effective and less time-consuming alternatives for SARS-CoV-2 testing.The RNA extraction-free method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva is a promising option.This study found that it has high sensitivity (85.34%), specificity (95.04%), and was comparable to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample tests.The method showed good agreement between salivary and NPS samples, with a kappa coefficient of 0.797.However, there are variations in the sensitivity and specificity based on the RT-PCR kit used.The Thermo Fisher Applied Biosystems showed high sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) but also showed a higher percentage of invalid reports.On the other hand, the BGI kit showed high specificity, better agreement (kappa coefficient) between the results of saliva and NPS samples, and higher correlation between the Ct values of saliva and NPS samples.Thus, the RNA extraction-free method for salivary sample serves as an effective alternative screening method for COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel infectious member of the coronavirus family, has caused millions of cases of infection and deaths all over the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.Conventional laboratory-based diagnostic testing has faced extreme difficulties in meeting the overwhelming demand for testing worldwide, and this has brought about a pressing need for cost-effective rapid diagnosis.There has been a surge in the number of prototypes of diagnostic kits developed, although many of these have been found to be lacking in terms of their accuracy and sensitivity.One type of chip-based diagnostic platform is the aptamer-based biosensor.Aptamers are artificially synthesized oligonucleotides that are capable of specifically binding to a target antigen.As of now, some aptamers have been reported for SARS-CoV-2.Although many ultrasensitive aptasensors have been developed for viruses, few have been successfully adapted for SARS-CoV-2 detection.Our review discusses the recent developments in the domain of SARS-CoV-2 specific aptamer isolation, the design of electrochemical and optical aptasensors, and the implications of aptasensor-based COVID-19 diagnosis. Since the initial reports of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unidentified origin in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus that causes this disease - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has spread throughout the world, igniting the twenty-first centurys deadliest pandemic.Over the past 12 months, a dizzying array of information has emerged from numerous laboratories, covering everything from the putative origin of SARS-CoV-2 to the development of numerous candidate vaccines.Many immunologists quickly pivoted from their existing research to focus on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and, owing to this unprecedented convergence of efforts on one viral infection, a remarkable body of work has been produced and disseminated, through both preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals.Here, we take readers through the timeline of key discoveries during the first year of the pandemic, which showcases the extraordinary leaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and highlights gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future investigations. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide, therefore there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify infected cases.Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples.To address this, several groups have recently reported the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection.Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection.Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes.Incorporation of RT-LAMP with fluorescent detection further increases the detection sensitivity to as little as 100 RNA copies.We also note the shortcomings of some LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions and clinical saliva samples.Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have faster kinetics for detection but varying degrees of false positives detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30 min reaction time, which highlights the importance of optimal primer design to minimise false-positives in RT-LAMP.This study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays as a rapid, highly sensitive detection method for SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in development of point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak and widely spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern.COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented and profound impact on the whole world, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge remains to be solved.The retrospective analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important information of this pandemic.We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).The patients features including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed.Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics.SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05).The median window period from the occurrence of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4 days).The median interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 14 days (interquartile range, 8-19.25 days).This study reveals the comprehensive characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 replication requires the synthesis of a set of structural proteins expressed through discontinuous transcription of ten subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs).Here, we have fine-tuned droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays to accurately detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genomic ORF1ab and sgmRNAs for the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins.We analyzed 166 RNA samples from anonymized SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects and we observed a recurrent and characteristic pattern of sgmRNAs expression in relation to the total viral RNA content.Additionally, expression profiles of sgmRNAs, as determined by meta-transcriptomics sequencing of a subset of 110 RNA samples, were highly correlated with those obtained by ddPCR.By providing a comprehensive and dynamic snapshot of the levels of SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNAs in infected individuals, our results may contribute a better understanding of the dynamics of transcription and expression of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate the development of more accurate molecular diagnostic tools for the stratification of COVID-19 patients. Incarcerated populations have experienced disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19-related illness and death compared with the general U.S. population, due in part to congregate living environments that can facilitate rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19 (1,2).The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant has caused outbreaks among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in congregate settings and large public gatherings (3,4).During July 2021, a COVID-19 outbreak involving the Delta variant was identified in a federal prison in Texas, infecting 172 of 233 (74%) incarcerated persons in two housing units.The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) partnered with CDC to investigate.CDC analyzed data on infection status, symptom onset date, hospitalizations, and deaths among incarcerated persons.The attack rate was higher among unvaccinated versus fully vaccinated persons (39 of 42, 93% versus 129 of 185, 70%; p = 0.002).Four persons were hospitalized, three of whom were unvaccinated, and one person died, who was unvaccinated.Among a subset of 70 persons consenting to an embedded serial swabbing protocol, the median interval between symptom onset and last positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result in fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons was similar (9 versus 11 days, p = 0.37).One or more specimens were culture-positive from five of 12 (42%) unvaccinated and 14 of 37 (38%) fully vaccinated persons for whom viral culture was attempted.In settings where physical distancing is challenging, including correctional and detention facilities, vaccination and implementation of multicomponent prevention strategies (e.g., testing, medical isolation, quarantine, and masking) are critical to limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission (5). When the novel coronavirus was described in late 2019, it could not have been imagined that within a year, more than 100 vaccine candidates would be in preclinical development and several would be in clinical trials and even approved for use.The scale of the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the scientific community, working in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, public health bodies, policymakers, funders and governments, to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at record-breaking speed.As well as driving major amendments to the usual timeframe for bringing a vaccine to fruition, the pandemic has accelerated the development of next-generation technologies for vaccinology, giving rise to two frontrunner RNA vaccines.Although none of the critical safety and efficacy steps have been skipped within the compressed schedules, and the technologies underpinning the novel vaccines have been refined by scientists over many years, a significant proportion of the global population is sceptical of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and wary of potential risks.In this interview-based article, we give an overview of how the vaccines were developed and how they work to generate a robust immune response against COVID-19, as well as addressing common questions relating to safety and efficacy. Messenger RNA (mRNA) BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials (1,2); however, the benefits of these vaccines for preventing asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection, particularly when administered in real-world conditions, is less well understood.Using prospective cohorts of health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers* in eight U.S. locations during December 14, 2020-March 13, 2021, CDC routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections every week regardless of symptom status and at the onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19-associated illness.Among 3,950 participants with no previous laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2,479 (62.8%) received both recommended mRNA doses and 477 (12.1%) received only one dose of mRNA vaccine.Among unvaccinated participants, 1.38 SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) per 1,000 person-days.In contrast, among fully immunized (14 days after second dose) persons, 0.04 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported, and among partially immunized (14 days after first dose and before second dose) persons, 0.19 infections per 1,000 person-days were reported.Estimated mRNA vaccine effectiveness for prevention of infection, adjusted for study site, was 90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization.These findings indicate that authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptom status, among working-age adults in real-world conditions.COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons. Understanding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is important.We describe a single-center cohort of COVID-19 PIBD patients where seroconversion against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was examined.Immunosuppressed PIBD patients at Texas Childrens Hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were included in the study.The clinical course of IBD, concurrent medications, COVID-19 related symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing date, and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing date and result were examined.Of 14 SARS-CoV-2 positive PIBD patients, 12 were tested for qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (seven with transient COVID-19 symptoms, five asymptomatic).All symptomatic (7/7) and 60% of asymptomatic (3/5) patients seroconverted.No patients required hospitalization attributed to COVID-19.High rates of COVID-19 seroconversion occurred in immunosuppressed and symptomatic PIBD patients.More research to evaluate the significance of COVID-19 seroconversion is needed. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, was first identified in humans in late 2019 and is a coronavirus which is zoonotic in origin.As it spread around the world there has been an unprecedented effort in developing effective vaccines.Computational methods can be used to speed up the long and costly process of vaccine development.Antigen selection, epitope prediction, and toxicity and allergenicity prediction are areas in which computational tools have already been applied as part of reverse vaccinology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.However, there is potential for computational methods to assist further.We review approaches which have been used and highlight additional bioinformatic approaches and PK modelling as in silico methods which may be useful for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design but remain currently unexplored.As more novel viruses with pandemic potential are expected to arise in future, these techniques are not limited to application to SARS-CoV-2 but also useful to rapidly respond to novel emerging viruses. ObjectiveTo describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and prognoses of COVID-19 confirmed patients in a single center in Beijing, China.Methods The study retrospectively included 19 patients with nucleic acid-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at our hospital from January 20 to March 5, 2020.The final follow-up date was March 14, 2020.The epidemiologic and clinical information was obtained through direct communication with the patients or their family members.Laboratory results retrieved from medical records and radiological images were analyzed both qualitatively by two senior chest radiologists as well as quantitatively via an artificial intelligence software.Results We identified 5 family clusters (13/19, 68.4%) from the study cohort.All cases had good clinical prognoses and were either mild (3/19) or moderate (16/19) clinical types.Fever (15/19, 78.9%) and dry cough (11/19, 57.9%) were common symptoms.Two patients received negative results for more than three consecutive viral nucleic acid tests.The longest interval between an initial CT abnormal finding and a confirmed diagnosis was 30 days.One patients nucleic acid test turned positive on the follow-up examination after discharge.The presence of radiological abnormalities was non-specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19.Conclusions COVID-19 patients with mild or no clinical symptoms are common in Beijing, China.Radiological abnormalities are mostly non-specific and massive CT examinations for COVID-19 screening should be avoided.Analyses of the contact histories of diagnosed cases in combination with clinical, radiological and laboratory findings are crucial for the early detection of COVID-19.Close monitoring after discharge is also recommended. Differential kinetics of RNA loads and infectious viral levels in the upper respiratory tract between asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected adult outpatients remain unclear limiting recommendations that may guide clinical management, infection control measures and occupational health decisions.In the present investigation, 496 (2.8%) of 17,911 French adult outpatients were positive for an upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by a quantitative RT-PCR assay, of which 180 (36.3%) were COVID-19 asymptomatic.Of these adult asymptomatic viral shedders, 75% had mean to high RNA viral loads (Ct values < 30) which median value was significantly higher than that observed in symptomatic subjects (P = 0.029), and 50.6% were positive by cell culture assays of their upper respiratory tract specimens.Our findings indicate that COVID-19 asymptomatic adult outpatients are significant viable SARS-CoV-2 shedders in their upper respiratory tract playing a major potential role as SARS-CoV-2 transmitters in various epidemiological transmission chains, promoting COVID-19 resurgence in populations. Public Health 3.0 calls for the inclusion of new partners and novel data to bring systemic change to the US public health landscape.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has illuminated significant data gaps influenced by ongoing colonial legacies of racism and erasure.American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and communities have been disproportionately affected by incomplete public health data and by the COVID-19 pandemic itself.Our findings indicate that only 26 US states were able to calculate COVID-19related death rates for AI/AN populations.Given that 37 states have Indian Health Service locations, we argue that public health researchers and practitioners should have a far larger data set of aggregated public health information on AI/AN populations.Despite enormous obstacles, local Tribal facilities have created effective community responses to COVID-19 testing, tracking, and vaccine administration.Their knowledge can lead the way to a healthier nation.Federal and state governments and health agencies must learn to responsibly support Tribal efforts, collect data from AI/AN persons in partnership with Indian Health Service and Tribal governments, and communicate effectively with Tribal authorities to ensure Indigenous data sovereignty.(Am J Public Health.2021;111(S3): S208-S214.https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306415). Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world.The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing.However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic.To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity.We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step.We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic.As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used.We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved.Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus. Mitigation of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory diagnostic services.In this study, the performance of one laboratory-developed test (LDT) and two commercial tests, cobas SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag COVID-19 (Mobidiag), were evaluated for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory specimens.A total of 183 specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance.In relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods, the positive percent agreement was highest for the cobas test (100%), followed by the Amplidiag test and the LDT (98.9%).The negative percent agreement was lowest for the cobas test (89.4%), followed by the Amplidiag test (98.8%), and the highest value was obtained for the LDT (100%).The dilution series of positive specimens, however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas assay in comparison with the other two assays, and the low negative percent agreement value may be due to the same reason.In general, all tested assays performed adequately.Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months to mitigate the pandemic.To ensure no interruption, it is critical that clinical laboratories maintain several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. We report the earliest known cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection so far reported, which occurred in New Zealand in late February 2020.The cluster includes one confirmed and five probable cases.The cluster was identified while investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020.The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing.SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection.Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a COVID-19 like illness in February 2020.Combined case histories and investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February.Case investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected.A weak positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of infectivity. The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the shortcomings of the current testing paradigm for viral disease diagnostics.Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2.The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles.This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles.Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/L.The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences.It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations.The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response.Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people across the world.The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day.Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control.Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19.The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19.Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration.Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose.The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue.No serious adverse events have been reported.Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus.Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand.Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation. Scaling up of diagnostic capacity is needed to mitigate the global pandemic of SARS-CoV2.However, there are challenges including shortage of sample collection swabs and transport medium.Saliva has been recommended as a simple, low-cost, non-invasive option.However, data from different populations and settings are limited.Here, we showed that saliva could be a good alternative sample to diagnose COVID-19 patients.Pair of NPS-saliva samples was collected from 152 symptomatic; confirmed COVID-19 patients, and compared their positivity rate, viral load, and duration of viral shedding.From 152 patients, 80 (52.63%) tested positive and 72 (47.37%) were negative for SARSA-CoV2 in NPS sample.In saliva, 129 (92.14%) were tested positive and 11 (7.86%) were negative on the day of admission to hospital.The overall percent agreement of RT-PCR result of Saliva to NPS was 70% (196/280).A comparison of viral load from 72 NPS-saliva pair samples on day of admission shows saliva contains significantly higher viral load (P < 0.001).In conclusion, saliva has higher yield in detecting SARS-CoV2, and COVID-19 patients show higher viral load and prolonged period of viral shedding in saliva.Therefore, we recommend saliva as a better alternative sample to NPS to diagnose COVID-19 patients. Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, government policy and healthcare implementation responses have been guided by reported positivity rates and counts of positive cases in the community.The selection bias of these data calls into question their validity as measures of the actual viral incidence in the community and as predictors of clinical burden.In the absence of any successful public or academic campaign for comprehensive or random testing, we have developed a proxy method for synthetic random sampling, based on viral RNA testing of patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system.We present here an approach under multilevel regression and poststratification to collecting and analyzing data on viral exposure among patients in a hospital system and performing statistical adjustment that has been made publicly available to estimate true viral incidence and trends in the community.We apply our approach to tracking viral behavior in a mixed urban-suburban-rural setting in Indiana.This method can be easily implemented in a wide variety of hospital settings.Finally, we provide evidence that this model predicts the clinical burden of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) earlier and more accurately than currently accepted metrics.See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B859. To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, colleges and universities have implemented multiple strategies including testing, isolation, quarantine, contact tracing, masking, and vaccination.In April 2021, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was notified of a large cluster of students with COVID-19 at an urban university after spring break.A total of 158 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed among undergraduate students during March 15-May 3, 2021; the majority (114; 72.2%) lived in on-campus dormitories.CDPH evaluated the role of travel and social connections, as well as the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants, on transmission.Among 140 infected students who were interviewed, 89 (63.6%) reported recent travel outside Chicago during spring break, and 57 (40.7%) reported indoor social exposures.At the time of the outbreak, undergraduate-aged persons were largely ineligible for vaccination in Chicago; only three of the students with COVID-19 (1.9%) were fully vaccinated.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 104 specimens revealed multiple distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting several nearly simultaneous introductions.Most specimens (66; 63.5%) were B.1.1.222, a lineage not widely detected in Chicago before or after this outbreak.These results demonstrate the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks on university campuses after widespread student travel during breaks, at the beginning of new school terms, and when students participate in indoor social gatherings.To prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, colleges and universities should encourage COVID-19 vaccination; discourage unvaccinated students from travel, including during university breaks; implement serial COVID-19 screening among unvaccinated persons after university breaks; encourage masking; and implement universal serial testing for students based on community transmission levels. Estimating the size of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the infection severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is made challenging by inconsistencies in the available data.The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2.In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3.Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries.We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected.We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years.Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios.Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries.This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available. The Covid-19 pandemic, a disease transmitted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has already caused the infection of more than 120 million people, of which 70 million have been recovered, while 3 million people have died.The high speed of infection has led to the rapid depletion of public health resources in most countries.RT-PCR is Covid-19s reference diagnostic method.In this work we propose a new technique for representing DNA sequences: they are divided into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach and represented by co-occurrence matrices.This technique eliminates multiple sequence alignment.Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a large database: 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARS-CoV-2.When comparing SARS-CoV-2 with virus families with similar symptoms, we obtained [Formula: see text] for sensitivity and [Formula: see text] for specificity with MLP classifier and 30% overlap.When SARS-CoV-2 is compared to other coronaviruses and healthy human DNA sequences, we obtained [Formula: see text] for sensitivity and [Formula: see text] for specificity with MLP and 50% overlap.Therefore, the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19 can be optimized by combining RT-PCR and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify DNA sequences for SARS-CoV-2 with greater specificity and sensitivity. Despite progress in clinical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1, population-wide interventions are still crucial to manage the pandemic, which has been aggravated by the emergence of new, highly transmissible variants.In this study, we combined the SIDARTHE model2, which predicts the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a new data-based model that projects new cases onto casualties and healthcare system costs.Based on the Italian case study, we outline several scenarios: mass vaccination campaigns with different paces, different transmission rates due to new variants and different enforced countermeasures, including the alternation of opening and closure phases.Our results demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have a higher effect on the epidemic evolution than vaccination alone, advocating for the need to keep NPIs in place during the first phase of the vaccination campaign.Our model predicts that, from April 2021 to January 2022, in a scenario with no vaccine rollout and weak NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 1.27), as many as 298,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 could occur.However, fast vaccination rollouts could reduce mortality to as few as 51,000 deaths.Implementation of restrictive NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 0.9) could reduce COVID-19 deaths to 30,000 without vaccinating the population and to 18,000 with a fast rollout of vaccines.We also show that, if intermittent open-close strategies are adopted, implementing a closing phase first could reduce deaths (from 47,000 to 27,000 with slow vaccine rollout) and healthcare system costs, without substantive aggravation of socioeconomic losses. During fall 2020, many U.S. kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools closed campuses and instituted remote learning to limit in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2).A New Jersey grade 9-12 boarding school with 520 full-time resident students, 255 commuter students, and 405 faculty and staff members implemented a comprehensive mitigation strategy that included universal masking, testing, upgraded air-handling equipment to improve ventilation, physical distancing of 6 ft, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation protocols to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among students, faculty, and staff members.Mandatory twice-weekly screening using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of all students and staff members during August 20-November 27, 2020, resulted in the testing of 21,449 specimens.A total of 19 (5%) of 405 faculty and staff members and eight (1%) of 775 students received positive test results; only two identified cases were plausibly caused by secondary transmission on campus.Comprehensive mitigation approaches including frequent testing and universal masking can help prevent outbreaks in in-person high school settings even when community transmission is ongoing. The present global pandemic triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has lingered for over a year in its devastating effects.Diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently established with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test by means of oropharyngeal-, nasopharyngeal-, anal-swabs, sputum and blood plasma.However, oral and nasal swabs are more commonly used.This study, therefore, assessed sensitivity and specificity of plasma as a diagnostic in comparison with a combination of oral and nasal swab samples, and the implications for blood transfusion.Oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were obtained from 125 individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and stored in viral transport medium (VTM) tubes.Ten millilitres of blood samples in EDTA were also obtained by venepuncture and spun to obtain plasma.Viral RNA was obtained from both swabs and plasma by manual extraction with Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit.Detection was done using a real time fluorescent RT-qPCR BGI kit, on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR instrument.Average age of study participants was 41 years, with 74 (59.2%) being male.Out of the 125 individuals tested for COVID-19, 75 (60%) were positive by OP/NP swab.However, only 6 (4.8%) had a positive plasma result for COVID-19 with median Ct value of 32.4.Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test using plasma was 8% and 100% respectively.There was no false positive recorded, but 69 (55.2%) false negatives were obtained by plasma.SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected, albeit low (4.8%) in plasma.Plasma is likely not a suitable biological sample to diagnose acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.The implication of transfusing blood in this era of COVID-19 needs further investigations. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections have adopted the shape of a global pandemic now, demanding an urgent vaccine design.The current work reports contriving an anti-coronavirus peptide scanner tool to discern anti-coronavirus targets in the embodiment of peptides.The proffered CoronaPep tool features the fast fingerprinting of the anti-coronavirus target serving supreme prominence in the current bioinformatics research.The anti-coronavirus target protein sequences reported from the current outbreak are scanned against the anti-coronavirus target data-sets via CORONAPEP which provides precision-based anti-coronavirus peptides.This tool is specifically for the coronavirus data, which can predict peptides from the whole genome, or a gene or proteins list.Besides it is relatively fast, accurate, userfriendly and can generate maximum output from the limited information.The availability of tools like CORONAPEP will immeasurably perquisite researchers in the discipline of oncology and structure-based drug design. Accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is essential to guide prevention and control of COVID-19.Here we examine SARS-CoV-2 molecular-based test performance characteristics and summarize case-level data related to COVID-19 diagnosis.From January 11 through April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods.We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens.Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE = 0.5, p<0.001).Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time.Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE = 0.5, p<0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases.Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive value of 95.5%.Molecular testing is the mainstay of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and testing protocols will continue to be dynamic and iteratively modified as more is learned about this emerging pathogen. Serological testing to evaluate antigen-specific antibodies in plasma is generally performed by rapid lateral flow test strips that lack quantitative results or by high complexity immunoassays that are time- and labor-intensive but provide semi-quantitative results.Here, we describe a novel application of biolayer interferometry for the rapid detection of antigen-specific antibody levels in plasma samples, and demonstrate its utility for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated "dip-and-read" format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection.Complete semi-quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 min.BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay.Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates.In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens. During the first wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic the clinical utility and indications for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing were not clearly defined.The urgency to deploy serological assays required rapid evaluation of their performance characteristics.We undertook an internal validation of a CE marked lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) using serum from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals and pre-pandemic samples.This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team.Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decision-making, were recorded.Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively.113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot.44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies.Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g.pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6).We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children.Greatest benefit was seen where there is reasonable pre-test probability and results can be linked with clinical advice or intervention.Experience from this pilot can help inform practicalities and benefits of rapidly implementing new tests such as LFIAs into clinical service as the pandemic evolves. SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and has since spread around the world, causing a pandemic of the respiratory disease COVID-19.Detecting antibodies against the virus is an essential tool for tracking infections and developing vaccines.Such tests, primarily utilizing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle, can be either qualitative (reporting positive/negative results) or quantitative (reporting a value representing the quantity of specific antibodies).Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections.Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series.To overcome the throughput limitations of this approach, we developed a simpler and faster system that is highly automatable and achieves quantitation in a single-dilution screening format with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of ELISA. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swab compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for COVID-19 testing in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore.We also tested the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for diagnosis of COVID-19.Saliva, NP and SN swabs were collected from subjects who presented with acute respiratory infection, their asymptomatic roommates, and prior confirmed cases who were undergoing isolation at a community care facility in June 2020.All samples were tested using RT-PCR.SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based NGS with phylogenetic analysis was done for 30 samples.We recruited 200 subjects, of which 91 and 46 were tested twice and thrice respectively.In total, 62.0%, 44.5%, and 37.7% of saliva, NP and SN samples were positive.Cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower during the earlier period of infection across all sample types.The percentage of test-positive saliva was higher than NP and SN swabs.We found a strong correlation between viral genome coverage by NGS and Ct values for SARS-CoV-2.Phylogenetic analyses revealed Clade O and lineage B.6 known to be circulating in Singapore.We found saliva to be a sensitive and viable sample for COVID-19 diagnosis. Recent studies have documented the emergence and rapid growth of B.1.526, a novel variant of interest (VOI) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the New York City (NYC) area after its identification in NYC in November 2020 (1-3).Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons.Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection.Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection.Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a large, well-described representative Viennese cohort after an early governmental lockdown with respect to the occurrence of symptoms and household transmission.Participants of the LEAD Study, a population-based cohort study from Vienna, Austria, were invited along with their household members (April 20th to May20th 2020).Sera were analyzed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay including a neutralization test as a confirmatory assay.A total of 12,419 individuals participated (5984 LEAD participants; 6435 household members), 163 (1.31%; 59 LEAD cohort members) of whom were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive.The estimated number of COVID-19 cases projected from our findings by age and sex for Vienna was 21,504 (1.13%).Cumulative number of positively tested cases in Vienna until May 20th 2020 was 3020, hence 7.1 times (95% confidence interval 5.5-9.1) lower than projected.Relative risk (RR) of seropositivity by age was highest for children aged 6-9 years [RR compared to age group 20-49: 1.21 (CI 0.37-4.01)], lowest for 65 years [RR 0.47 (CI 0.21-1.03)].Half of the positive individuals developed no or mild symptoms.In a multivariate analysis, taste and smell disturbances were most strongly related to SARS-CoV-2 positivity.Infection probability within households with one confirmed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-positive person was 31%.Although seroprevalence was very low (1.13%) for a central European capital city, due to an early governmental lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were more prevalent than officially reported polymerase chain reaction-positive cases.Of note, seroprevalence was highest in young children.Half of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects had no or only mild symptoms.Taste and smell disturbances were most prominent, possibly guiding clinicians in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).To halt the pandemic, multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed and several have been allowed for emergency use and rollout worldwide.With novel SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging and circulating widely, whether the original vaccines that were designed based on the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were effective against these variants has been a contentious discussion.Moreover, some studies revealed the long-term changes of immune responses post SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and the factors that might impact the vaccine-induced immunity.Thus, in this review, we have summarized the influence of mutational hotspots on the vaccine efficacy and characteristics of variants of interest and concern.We have also discussed the reasons that might result in discrepancies in the efficacy of different vaccines estimated in different trials.Furthermore, we provided an overview of the duration of immune responses after natural infection or vaccination and shed light on the factors that may affect the immunity induced by the vaccines, such as special disease conditions, sex, and pre-existing immunity, with the aim of aiding in combating COVID-19 and distributing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under the prevalence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Trials of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination included limited numbers of children, so they may not have detected rare but important adverse events in this population.We report 7 cases of acute myocarditis or myopericarditis in healthy male adolescents who presented with chest pain all within 4 days after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination.Five patients had fever around the time of presentation.Acute COVID-19 was ruled out in all 7 cases on the basis of negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results of specimens obtained by using nasopharyngeal swabs.None of the patients met criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.Six of the 7 patients had negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleocapsid antibody assay results, suggesting no previous infection.All patients had an elevated troponin.Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement characteristic of myocarditis.All 7 patients resolved their symptoms rapidly.Three patients were treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs only, and 4 received intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids.In this report, we provide a summary of each adolescents clinical course and evaluation.No causal relationship between vaccine administration and myocarditis has been established.Continued monitoring and reporting to the US Food and Drug Administration Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is strongly recommended. The alarming spread of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires several measures to reduce the risk of contagion.Every successful strategy in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on timely diagnosis, which should include testing of asymptomatic carriers.Consequently, increasing the throughput for clinical laboratories for the purposes of conducting large-scale diagnostic testing is urgently needed.Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects.We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of cost and time.The simulation data presented herein were used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations in which epidemiological and clinical data are used to create "informed" pools.Different scenarios were simulated to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for virus frequency.Our results allow for a customization of the pooling strategy according to the specific characteristics of the cohort being tested. Population screening played a substantial role in safely reopening the economy and avoiding new outbreaks of COVID-19.PCR-based pooled screening makes it possible to test the population with limited resources by pooling multiple individual samples.Our study compared different population-wide screening methods as transmission-mitigating interventions, including pooled PCR, individual PCR, and antigen screening.Incorporating testing-isolation process and individual-level viral load trajectories into an epidemic model, we further studied the impacts of testing-isolation on test sensitivities.Results show that the testing-isolation process could maintain a stable test sensitivity during the outbreak by removing most infected individuals, especially during the epidemic decline.Moreover, we compared the efficiency, accuracy, and cost of different screening methods during the pandemic.Our results show that PCR-based pooled screening is cost-effective in reversing the pandemic at low prevalence.When the prevalence is high, PCR-based pooled screening may not stop the outbreak.In contrast, antigen screening with sufficient frequency could reverse the epidemic, despite the high cost and the large numbers of false positives in the screening process. The high efficacy, low cost, and long shelf-life of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine positions it well for use in in diverse socioeconomic settings.Using data from clinical trials, an individual-based model was constructed to predict its 6-month population-level impact.Probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the importance of epidemiological, demographic and logistical factors on vaccine effectiveness.Rollout at various levels of availability and delivery speed, conditional on vaccine efficacy profiles (efficacy of each dose and interval between doses) were explored in representative countries.We highlight how expedient vaccine delivery to high-risk groups is critical in mitigating COVID-19 disease and mortality.In scenarios where the availability of vaccine is insufficient for high-risk groups to receive two doses, administration of a single dose of is optimal, even when vaccine efficacy after one dose is just 75% of the two doses.These findings can help inform allocation strategies particularly in areas constrained by availability. A key tenet of protection from infection for dentists is to know who is not infectious.The evidence base regarding protection from respiratory pathogens in dentistry is poor.Those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody are non-infectious (>99% certainty) and can be safely treated with good universal precautions, even for aerosol generating procedures.Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks.SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection.SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA.So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive.It remains to be seen whether SARS-Cov-2 vaccine responses include protective IgG titres and, once vaccines become widespread, can be used to assist decision-making on appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in dentistry. With the ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), there is a need for sensitive, specific, and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom are symptomatic.The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), with many commercial kits now available for this purpose.However, these are expensive, and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed.We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside a human cellular control (RPP30) and a viral spike-in control (Phocine Herpes Virus 1 [PhHV-1]), which monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency, respectively.Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost.Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by combined nose and throat swabbing and establish a statistically significant correlation between the detected level of human and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids.The inclusion of the human control probe in our assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of sample quality that could help reduce false-negative rates.We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a robust RT-qPCR assay at approximately 10% of the cost of equivalent commercial assays, which could benefit low-resource environments and make high-volume testing affordable. A two-dose regimen of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) Covid-19 vaccine with an inter-dose interval of three months has been implemented in many countries with restricted vaccine supply.However, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 by dose in elderly populations in countries with high prevalence of the Gamma variant of SARS-CoV-2.Here, we estimate ChAdOx1 effectiveness by dose against the primary endpoint of RT-PCR-confirmed Covid-19, and secondary endpoints of Covid-19 hospitalization and Covid-19-related death, in adults aged 60 years during an epidemic with high Gamma variant prevalence in So Paulo state, Brazil using a matched, test-negative case-control study.Starting 28 days after the first dose, effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 is 33.4% (95% CI, 26.4-39.7) against Covid-19, 55.1% (95% CI, 46.6-62.2) against hospitalization, and 61.8% (95% CI, 48.9-71.4) against death.Starting 14 days after the second dose, effectiveness of the two-dose schedule is 77.9% (95% CI, 69.2-84.2) against Covid-19, 87.6% (95% CI, 78.2-92.9) against hospitalization, and 93.6% (95% CI, 81.9-97.7) against death.Completion of the ChAdOx1 vaccine schedule affords significantly increased protection over a single dose against mild and severe Covid-19 outcomes in elderly individuals during widespread Gamma variant circulation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) total antibodies in the north, middle, and south regions of West Bank and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgA, IgM, and IgG) in the Palestinian population.This was a cross-sectional study.The serological and epidemiological data of 1269 persons were assessed.Participants were selected randomly among primary health care center attendees in Palestine between November 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020.All serum samples were tested for total antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test.IgM, IgG, and IgA-specific antibody titers were measured using ELISA.The overall prevalence (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies and specific antibodies were estimated.A multivariate regression model was used to assess the predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 240% (95% CI, 217%-265%).Seroprevalence was significantly higher among people living in south West Bank (adjusted Odds ratio [aOR], 222; 95% CI: 158-311), people who had COVID-19 symptoms (aOR, 392; 95% CI, 283-543), people with a COVID-19 contact history (aOR, 144; 95% CI, 103-203), patients with hypertension (aOR, 157; 95% CI, 106-233), and non-smokers (aOR, 047; 95% CI, 031-072).A total of 171 blood samples from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were chosen at random for additional serological testing.Specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies were positive in 140% (95% CI, 92%-202%), 883% (825%-927%), and 421% (346%-599%) of the samples, respectively.SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were common among PHC center attendees and were significantly associated to sex, smoking, and COVID-19 contact history.However, considering that almost three-quarters of this population remains susceptible, maintaining public health measures and encouraging access to immunization is critical in protecting this population. Rapid and widespread testing of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for an effective public health response aimed at containing and mitigating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Successful health policy implementation relies on early identification of infected individuals and extensive contact tracing.However, rural communities, where resources for testing are sparse or simply absent, face distinctive challenges to achieving this success.Accordingly, we report the development of an academic, public land grant University laboratory-based detection assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from various clinical specimens that can be readily deployed in areas where access to testing is limited.The test, which is a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based procedure, was validated on samples provided by the state laboratory and submitted for FDA Emergency Use Authorization.Our test exhibits comparable sensitivity and exceeds specificity and inclusivity values compared to other molecular assays.Additionally, this test can be re-configured to meet supply chain shortages, modified for scale up demands, and is amenable to several clinical specimens.Test development also involved 3D engineering critical supplies and formulating a stable collection media that allowed samples to be transported for hours over a dispersed rural region without the need for a cold-chain.These two elements that were critical when shortages impacted testing and when personnel needed to reach areas that were geographically isolated from the testing center.Overall, using a robust, easy-to-adapt methodology, we show that an academic laboratory can supplement COVID-19 testing needs and help local health departments assess and manage outbreaks.This additional testing capacity is particularly germane for smaller cities and rural regions that would otherwise be unable to meet the testing demand. The rapid spread and evolution of various strains of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, continues to challenge the disease controlling measures globally.Alarming concern is, the number of second wave infections surpassed the first wave and the onset of severe symptoms manifesting rapidly.In this scenario, testing of maximum population in less time and minimum cost with existing diagnostic amenities is the only possible way to control the spread of the virus.The previously described RNA extraction-free methods using dry swab have been shown to be advantageous in these critical times by different studies.In this work, we show the temporal stability and performance of the dry swab viral detection method at two different temperatures.Contrived dry swabs holding serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 strains A2a and A3i at 25C (room temperature; RT) and 4C were subjected to direct RT-PCR and compared with standard VTM-RNA based method.The results clearly indicate that dry swab method of RNA detection is as efficient as VTM-RNA-based method in both strains, when checked for up to 72 h. The lesser CT values of dry swab samples in comparison to that of the VTM-RNA samples suggest better sensitivity of the method within 48 h of time.The results collectively suggest that dry swab samples are stable at RT for 24 h and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR do not show variance from VTM-RNA.This extraction free, direct RT-PCR method holds phenomenal standing in the present life-threatening circumstances due to SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has posed an international public health emergency worldwide and forced people to be confined in their homes.This virus is of high-risk category and is declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).The worldwide researchers and various health professionals are working together to determine the best way to stop its spread or halt this viruss spread and circumvent this pandemic condition threatening millions of human lives.The absence of definitive treatment is possible to explore to reduce virus infection and enhance patient recovery.Along with off-label medicines, plasma therapy, vaccines, the researchers exploit the various plants/herbs and their constituents to effectively treat nCoV infection.The present study aimed to present brief and most informative salient features of the numerous facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2, including the structure, genomic sequence, recent mutation, targeting possibility, and various hurdles in research progress, and off-labeled drugs, convalescent plasma therapy, vaccine and plants/herbs for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).Results showed that off-labeled drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, antiviral drug (remdesivir, favipiravir), etc., give positive results and approved for use or approved for restricted use in some countries like India.Future research should focus on these possibilities that may allow the development of an effective treatment for COVID-19. The Brazilian strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 has been particularly criticized due to the lack of a national coordinating effort and an appropriate testing program.Here, a successful approach to control the spread of COVID-19 transmission is described by the engagement of public (university and governance) and private sectors (hospitals and oil companies) in Maca, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a city known as the National Oil Capital.In 2020 between the 17th and 38th epidemiological week, over two percent of the 206,728 citizens were subjected to symptom analysis and RT-qPCR testing by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with positive individuals being notified up to 48 h after swab collection.Geocodification and spatial cluster analysis were used to limit COVID-19 spreading in Maca.Within the first semester after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Brazil, Maca recorded 1.8% of fatalities associated with COVID-19 up to the 38th epidemiological week, which was at least five times lower than the state capital (10.6%).Overall, considering the successful experience of this joint effort of private and public engagement in Maca, our data suggest that the development of a similar strategy countrywise could have contributed to a better control of the COVID-19 spread in Brazil.Quarantine decree by the local administration, comprehensive molecular testing coupled to scientific analysis of COVID-19 spreading, prevented the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic as seen in other populous cities within the state of Rio de Janeiro and elsewhere in Brazil. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread across the world, killing more than 4 million individuals globally, with 240 million individuals being confirmed by laboratory tests.Among different therapeutic strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccines are the most promising approach for curbing the pandemic.They elicit an immune neutralizing response and thus offer protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).However, some questions regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been raised and based on sparse reports of severe systemic reactions after vaccination.Among these, evidences on the potential effect of vaccination on the acute rise in blood pressure have been recently accrued.Approved vaccines in Europe increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells.Once synthetized in the cells reached by the vaccine, the Spike proteins first assemble in the cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell surface to protrude with a native-like conformation.Spike proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response.Furthermore, the Spike proteins assembled in the cells which are eventually destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood as free-floating forms.Free-floating Spike proteins may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors leading to internalization, degradation, and dysregulation of the catalytic activities of these receptors.The consequent loss of ACE2 receptor activity leads to a rapid drop in the generation of angiotensin1,7 resulting from inactivation of angiotensin II.The imbalance between angiotensin II (overactivity) and of angiotensin1,7 (deficiency) might play a role in the genesis of acute elevation in blood pressure. The novel human infectious coronaviruses (CoVs) responsible for severe respiratory syndromes have raised concerns owing to the global public health emergencies they have caused repeatedly over the past two decades.However, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received unprecedented attention internationally.Monitoring pathogenic CoVs in environmental compartments has been proposed as a promising strategy in preventing the environmental spread and tracing of infectious diseases, but a lack of reliable and efficient detection techniques is still a significant challenge.Moreover, the lack of information regarding the monitoring methodology may pose a barrier to primary researchers.Here, we provide a systematic introduction focused on the detection of CoVs in various environmental matrices, comprehensively involving methods and techniques of sampling, pretreatment, and analysis.Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges and potential improvements in virus detection techniques for environmental surveillance. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the biggest public health threats in the 21st century.Nearly every country in the world has been affected by COVID-19.The magnitude of the problem, with over 179 million confirmed cases and 3.8 million deaths worldwide, has driven researchers to search for vaccines to combat the disease.The discovery and development of a new vaccine, from the initial stage to the vaccine finally reaching the patients, usually take many years.However, given the urgency of the situation, many clinical trials on the COVID-19 vaccines have been conducted at extraordinary speed, whereas several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being administered worldwide.This article gives an overview of the different types of COVID-19 vaccines, with a focus on those with promising results and are commonly used worldwide.It also gives an overview of herd immunity and discusses the challenges in achieving herd immunity through the global vaccination campaigns.Last but not least, some strategies that may be used to address these challenges are discussed. Healthcare personnel are at risk to aquire the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).We evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and positive nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in German intensive care and emergency physicians.Physicians attending intensive care and emergency medicine training courses between June 16th and July 2nd 2020 answered a questionnaire and were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via automated electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay.We recruited 516 physicans from all parts of Germany, 445/516 (86%) worked in high risk areas, and 379/516 (73%) had treated patients with COVID-19.The overall positive rate was 18/516 (3.5%), 16/18 (89%) had antibodies against SARS-COV-2, another 2 reported previous positive RT-PCR results although antibody testing was negative.Of those positive, 7/18 (39%) were unaware of their infection.A stay abroad was stated by 173/498 (35%), mostly in Europe.87/516 (17%) reported a febrile respiratory infection after January 1st 2020 which was related to SARS-CoV-2 in 4/87 (4.6%).Contact to COVID-19 positive relatives at home was stated by 22/502 (4.4%).This was the only significant risk factor for Covid-19 infection (Fishers exact test, p = 0.0005).N95 masks and eye protection devices were available for 87% and 73%, respectively.A total of 254/502 (51%) had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza.The overall SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of german physicians from intensive care and emergency medicine was low compared to reports from other countries and settings.This finding may be explained by the fact that the German health care system was not overwhelmed by the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since its emergence as a pneumonia-like outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread widely to become a global pandemic.The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 and since then it has affected more than ten million people and resulted in around 150,000 deaths in the country.Over time, the viral genome has accumulated mutations as it passes through its human hosts, a common evolutionary mechanism found in all microorganisms.This has implications for disease surveillance and management, vaccines and therapeutics, and the emergence of reinfections.Sequencing the viral genome can help monitor these changes and provides an extraordinary opportunity to understand the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus as well as tracking its spread in a population.Here we review the past year in the context of the phylogenetic analysis of variants isolated over the course of the pandemic in India and highlight the importance of continued sequencing-based surveillance in the country. School closures affected more than 55 million students across the United States when implemented as a strategy to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1).Reopening schools requires balancing the risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection to students and staff members against the benefits of in-person learning (2).During December 3, 2020-January 31, 2021, CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 20 elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 6) that had reopened in Salt Lake County, Utah.The 7-day cumulative number of new COVID-19 cases in Salt Lake County during this time ranged from 290 to 670 cases per 100,000 persons.Susceptible school contacts (students and staff members exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in school) of 51 index patients** (40 students and 11 staff members) were offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.Among 1,041 susceptible school contacts, 735 (70.6%) were tested, and five of 12 cases identified were classified as school-associated; the secondary attack rate among tested susceptible school contacts was 0.7%.Mask use among students was high (86%), and the median distance between students seats in classrooms was 3 ft.Despite high community incidence and an inability to maintain 6 ft of distance between students at all times, SARS-CoV-2 transmission was low in these elementary schools.The results from this investigation add to the increasing evidence that in-person learning can be achieved with minimal SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk when multiple measures to prevent transmission are implemented (3,4). Amperial is a novel assay platform that uses immobilized antigen in a conducting polymer gel followed by detection via electrochemical measurement of oxidation-reduction reaction between H2O2/Tetrametylbenzidine and peroxidase enzyme in a completed assay complex.A highly specific and sensitive assay was developed to quantify levels of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.After establishing linearity and limit of detection we established a reference range of 5 standard deviations above the mean.There were no false positives in 667 consecutive saliva samples obtained prior to 2019.Saliva was obtained from 34 patients who had recovered from documented COVID-19 or had documented positive serologies.All of the patients with symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention had positive antibody tests and 88% overall had positive results.We obtained blinded paired saliva and plasma samples from 14 individuals.The plasma was analyzed using an EUA-FDA cleared ELISA kit and the saliva was analyzed by our Amperial assay.All 5 samples with negative plasma titers were negative in saliva testing.Eight of the 9 positive plasma samples were positive in saliva and 1 had borderline results.A CLIA validation was performed as a laboratory developed test in a high complexity laboratory.A quantitative non-invasive saliva based SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was developed and validated with sufficient specificity to be useful for population-based monitoring and monitoring of individuals following vaccination. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus).A consistent number of case reports and clinical series have been already published describing a complex spectrum of skin manifestations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection.We carried out a review of the English-language literature up to 20 May 2020, reporting original cases or case series of the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate.The search of papers was conducted by using the key term COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus combined with each of the following: skin, cutaneous, dermatologic or dermatology, manifestation, lesions, or rash.The patterns of dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be classified into four categories: exanthema (varicella-like, papulo-vesicular and morbilliform rash), vascular (chilblain-like, purpuric/petechial and livedoid lesions), urticarial and acro-papular eruption.Lastly, other skin manifestations to be considered are the cutaneous adverse reactions to the drugs prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19.Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly cause a worsening of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis remains to be determined.Dermatologys outlook in the COVID-19 pandemic is multidimensional. A comprehensive clinical and microbiological assessments of COVID-19 in front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) is needed.Between April 10th and May 28th, 2020, 319 HCWs with acute illness were reviewed.In addition to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR screening, a multiplex molecular panel was used for testing other respiratory pathogens.For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load, viral culture, and virus neutralization assays were performed weekly.For SARS-CoV-2 negative HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month after inclusion.Among the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 65/67 (97.0%) developed mild form of COVID-19.Other respiratory pathogens were found in 6/66 (9.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 47/241 (19.5%) SARS-Cov-2 negative HCWs (p = 0.07).The proportion of HCWs with a viral load > 5.0 log10 cp/mL (Ct value < 25) was less than 15% at 8 days after symptom onset; 12% of HCWs were positive after 40 days (Ct > 37).More than 90% of cultivable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log10 cp/mL (Ct < 26) and were collected within 10 days after symptom onset.Among negative HCWs, 6/190 (3.2%) seroconverted.Our data suggest that the determination of viral load can be used for appreciating the infectiousness of infected HCWs.These data could be helpful for facilitating their return to work. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of two newly developed, point-of-care, rapid antigen tests (RATs) for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the AFIAS COVID-19 Ag and the ichromaTM COVID-19 Ag, and investigated antigen kinetics.A total of 200 serially collected nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from 38 COVID-19 patients and 122 specimens from negative controls were analyzed.Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed in comparison to molecular test results and subdivided according to targeted genes (E, RdRP, and N) and days post-symptom onset (PSO).For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO.Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) < 25.The specificity of AFIAS was 98.798.9% and that of ichromaTM was 100.0%.The kappa values of AFIAS and ichromaTM for the molecular testing of specimens with Ct < 25 (RdRP) were 0.97 and 1.00, respectively.The sensitivity of AFIAS and ichromaTM for all genes was lower for specimens collected at 814 PSO than for those collected before 7-days PSO.The kinetics profiles showed that antigen levels gradually decreased from 7-days PSO to > 22-days PSO.Both RATs showed excellent specificity and acceptable sensitivity for NP specimens with higher viral loads and for specimens collected within 7-days PSO.Hence, they have the potential to become useful tools for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2.However, because of concerns about false negativity, RATs should be used in conjunction with molecular tests. As the COVID-19 infection continues to ravage the world, the advent of an efficient as well as the economization of the existing RT-PCR based detection assay essentially can become a blessing in these testing times and significantly help in the management of the pandemic.This study demonstrated an innovative and rapid corroboration of COVID-19 test based on innovative multiplex PCR.An assessment of optimal PCR conditions to simultaneously amplify the SARS-CoV-2 genes E, S and RdRp has been made by fast-conventional and HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR using the same sets of primers.All variables of practical value were studied by amplifying known target-sequences from ten-fold dilutions of archived positive samples of COVID-19 disease.The multiplexing with newly designed E, S and RdRp primers have shown an efficient amplification of the target region of SARS-CoV-2.A distinct amplification was observed in 37 min using thermal cycler while it took 96 min in HRM coupled real time detection using SYBR green over a wide range of template concentrations.Our findings revealed decent concordance with other commercially available detection kits.This fast HRM coupled multiplex real-time PCR with SYBR green approach offers rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a cost-effective manner apart from the added advantage of primer compatibility for use in conventional multiplex PCR.The highly reproducible novel approach can propel extended applicability for developing sustainable commercial product besides providing relief to a resource limited setting. A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to infect more than 100 million people globally, with mortality reaching nearly 3 million as of March 2021.The symptoms vary widely, from the absence of any symptoms to death.The severity of COVID-19 relates to hyperinflammatory conditions with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which leads to multiple-organ failure and death.Innate immunity plays an important role in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and regulates the pathogenesis and its clinical outcomes.The most severe cases of COVID-19 present with increased innate immune cell infiltration in the lung, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood serum that are associated with disease severity.Here we review the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the recent reports and discuss the potential roles of innate immune cells and their mediators in pathogenesis that dictate the outcome of the disease.Understanding the roles of innate immune responses at the initial stages of infection may provide early windows into treatment and clues for vaccine development. Vaccination has played a crucial role in the improvement of global health.Some of the worlds deadliest diseases, like smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated with the help of vaccines, and many others have been restrained.The appearance of the strain of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and its impact on global health have made the development of effective and safe vaccines crucial for this new lethal disease.So far, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines in use around the world: messenger RNA-based vaccines, adenoviral vector vaccines, and inactivated whole-virus vaccines.Some of them have passed through phase 3 of safety and efficacy trials and are widely used for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.A plethora of cutaneous adverse events have been reported, most of them mild or moderate injection-site reactions.Some rare delayed inflammatory reactions such as "COVID arm" have also been reported, posing questions on their pathophysiology and clinical importance.Some rare serious adverse events, such as vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis, have been described raising great concerns on the safety of some widely spread vaccines.More data need to be collected with further and more detailed analysis.The overall risk of such severe adverse reactions remains extremely low, and the benefits of the existing vaccines in combating the widespread threat of COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risk of their side effects. In early 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rare cases were reported in children and adolescents of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).MIS-C is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction and usually presents late in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Since May 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded all reported cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and adolescents in the USA.In April 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised its clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing hyperinflammation and MIS-C.There are several challenges ahead for preventing, diagnosing, and managing MIS-C, particularly following the rapid emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2.This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C and includes some updates from population studies and clinical guidelines. The variant 20I/501Y.V1, associated to a higher risk of transmissibility, emerged in Nice city (Southeast of France, French Riviera) during January 2021.The pandemic has resumed late December 2020 in this area.A high incidence rate together with a fast turn-over of the main circulating variants, provided us the opportunity to analyze modifications in clinical profile and outcome traits.We performed an observational study in the University hospital of Nice from December 2020 to February 2021.We analyzed data of sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from the sewage collector and PCR screening from all positive samples at the hospital.Then, we described the characteristics of all COVID-19 patients admitted in the emergency department (ED) (n = 1247) and those hospitalized in the infectious diseases ward or ICU (n = 232).The UK-variant was absent in this area in December, then increasingly spread in January representing 59% of the PCR screening performed mid-February.The rate of patients over 65 years admitted to the ED decreased from 63 to 50% (p = 0.001).The mean age of hospitalized patients in the infectious diseases ward decreased from 70.7 to 59.2 (p < 0.001) while the proportion of patients without comorbidity increased from 16 to 42% (p = 0.007).Spread of the UK-variant in the Southeast of France affects younger and healthier patients. The high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), and our limited understanding of the biology of the novel coronavirus, as well as the lack of an effective treatment for COVID-19, have created a global pandemic.Those most likely to become seriously ill with COVID-19 are adults, especially the elderly and those who are already weak or sick.At present, a specific drug for treatment of COVID-19 has not been developed.This, combined with the typical coexistence of a variety of chronic diseases in elderly patients, makes treatment challenging at present.In addition, for elderly patients, COVID-19 isolation measures during the epidemic can easily lead to psychological problems.Thus, how to manage elderly patients has become a focus of social attention in the current circumstances.This article reviews the effects of COVID-19 and makes management suggestions for elderly patients during this epidemic period.In addition to the elderly, critically ill people are also highly susceptible to this novel coronavirus.For elderly COVID-19 patients, antiviral therapy, immune regulation, and even auxiliary respiratory therapy can be given after a comprehensive evaluation of the disease.With the approval and use of COVID-19 vaccines, it is reasonable to expect that we can conquer SARS-CoV-2. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is an important tool for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).However, performance concerns have emerged recently, notably regarding sensitivity.We hypothesized that the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with a false-negative first RT-PCR test and a final diagnosis of COVID-19 might differ from those of patients with a positive first RT-PCR test.We conducted a multicenter matched case-control study in COVID-19 patients.Patients with a negative first RT-PCR test were matched to patients with a positive first RT-PCR test on age, sex, and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care).We included 80 cases and 80 controls between March 30, and June 22, 2020.Neither mortality at hospital discharge nor hospital stay length differed between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.54, respectively).By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a lower risk of a first false-negative test, namely, headache (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01-0.49]; P = 0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81; P = 0.027); two other factors were independently associated with a higher risk of a first false-negative test, namely, platelets > 207103 mm-3 (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.10-13.16]; P = 0.034) and C-reactive protein > 79.8 mgL-1 (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.21-13.19; P = 0.023).Patients with suspected COVID-19 whose laboratory tests indicating marked inflammation were at higher risk of a first false-negative RT-PCR test.Strategies involving serial RT-PCR testing must be rigorously evaluated. A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay that does not require Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) reagents was tested and validated for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early stages of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Republic of Korea.Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures.We validated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and robustness of the RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection and compared its performance with that of several EUA-approved kits.Our RT-qPCR assay was highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by not amplifying 13 other viruses that cause respiratory diseases.The assay showed high linearity using a viral isolate from a patient with known COVID-19 as well as plasmids containing target SARS-CoV-2 genes as templates.The assay showed good repeatability and reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 3%, and a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection of 1 PFU/mL.The RT-qPCR-based assay is highly effective and can facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 without the use of EUA-approved kits or reagents in the Republic of Korea. While vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are being administered, in many countries it may still take months until their supply can meet demand.The majority of available vaccines elicit strong immune responses when administered as prime-boost regimens.Since the immunological response to the first ("prime") dose may provide already a substantial reduction in infectiousness and protection against severe disease, it may be more effective-under certain immunological and epidemiological conditions-to vaccinate as many people as possible with only one dose instead of administering a person a second ("booster") dose.Such a vaccination campaign may help to more effectively slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce hospitalizations and fatalities.The conditions that make prime-first vaccination favorable over prime-boost campaigns, however, are not well understood.By combining epidemiological modeling, random-sampling techniques, and decision tree learning, we find that prime-first vaccination is robustly favored over prime-boost vaccination campaigns even for low single-dose efficacies.For epidemiological parameters that describe the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recent data on new variants included, we show that the difference between prime-boost and single-shot waning rates is the only discriminative threshold, falling in the narrow range of 0.01-0.02 day-1 below which prime-first vaccination should be considered. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global health challenge, creating sudden, massive demands for diagnostic testing, treatment, therapies, and vaccines.In particular, the development of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 has been pursued as they are needed for quarantine, disease surveillance, and patient treatment.One of the major lessons the pandemic highlighted was the need for fast, cheap, scalable and reliable diagnostic methods, such as paper-based assays.Furthermore, it has previously been suggested that paper-based tests may be more suitable for settings with lower resource availability and may help alleviate some supply chain challenges which arose during the COVID-19 pandemic.Therefore, we explore how such devices may fit in a comprehensive diagnostic strategy and how some of the challenges to the technology, e.g.low sensitivity, may be addressed.We discuss the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, the COVID-19 disease pathway, and the immune response.We then describe the different diagnostic strategies that have been pursued, focusing on molecular strategies for viral genetic material, antigen tests, and serological assays, and innovations for improving the diagnostic sensitivity and capabilities.Finally, we discuss pressing issues for the future, and what needs to be addressed for the ongoing pandemic and future outbreaks. Recently, an increasing number of cases with delayed cutaneous reaction after immunization with mRNA-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported.This adverse reaction, which is considered a delayed-type or T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, has been described for the Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2) vaccines.We describe a delayed large local cutaneous reaction in a patient who received the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca).The time course and clinical symptoms of delayed skin reaction after mRNA vaccines have a similar pattern that we recognized in our patient after Vaxzevria vaccination.This phenomenon has not been described in the Vaxzevria clinical trials and is to our knowledge the first report of this adverse reaction to a vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.With this, we hope to raise awareness about delayed injection site reactions that also occur after viral vector vaccines and to encourage additional reporting and patient education regarding the cutaneous reactions after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Roughly 1 year after the first case of COVID-19 was identified and less than 1 year after the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with demonstrated safety and efficacy in phase III clinical trials are available.The most promising vaccines have targeted the surface glycoprotein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and achieved an approximate 85%-95% reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, while retaining excellent safety profiles and modest side effects in the phase III clinical trials.The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed.Some novel SARS-CoV-2 variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by these vaccines.Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection from severe COVID-19.This is an impressive first demonstration of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine and vector vaccine platforms.The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be credited to open science, industry partnerships, harmonization of clinical trials, and the altruism of study participants.The manufacturing and distribution of the emergency use-authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are ongoing challenges.What remains now is to ensure broad and equitable global vaccination against COVID-19. Worldwide infections and fatalities caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants responsible for COVID-19 have significantly impeded the economic growth of many nations.People in many nations have lost their livelihoods, it has severely impacted international relations and, most importantly, health infrastructures across the world have been tormented.This pandemic has already left footprints on human psychology, traits, and priorities and is certainly going to lead towards a new world order in the future.As always, science and technology have come to the rescue of the human race.The prevention of infection by instant and repeated cleaning of surfaces that are most likely to be touched in daily life and sanitization drives using medically prescribed sanitizers and UV irradiation of textiles are the first steps to breaking the chain of transmission.However, the real challenge is to develop and uplift medical infrastructure, such as diagnostic tools capable of prompt diagnosis and instant and economic medical treatment that is available to the masses.Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are atomic sheets that have been in the news for quite some time due to their unprecedented electronic mobilities, high thermal conductivity, appreciable thermal stability, excellent anchoring capabilities, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, and a unique capability to integrate with arbitrary surfaces.These attributes of 2D materials make them lucrative for use as an active material platform for authentic and prompt (within minutes) disease diagnosis via electrical or optical diagnostic tools or via electrochemical diagnosis.We present the opportunities provided by 2D materials as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern.WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease on March 11, 2020 and characterized by fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases.The virus has spread to at least 213 countries and more than 9093827 confirmed cases and 471490 deaths have been recorded.In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread.There are some newly developed and promising methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2, in order to facilitate the development of novel approaches for early diagnosis.Nucleic acid based tests currently offer the most sensitive and early detection and confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.Among them Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most popular and the "gold standard" testing method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.The present study was carried out to detect 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by rRT-PCR method at Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from 1st April, 2020 to 31st May, 2020.A total of 14356 samples were tested from four districts of Mymensingh division namely, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Netrokona and some parts of Sunamganj for rRT-PCR.Among them 1086 (7.5%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2.Out of 1086 positive cases 716(65.9%) were male and 370(34.1%) were female with a MeanSD age 34.112 years.Maximum positivity was found in Mymensingh district followed by Netrokona, Jamalpur, Sherpur and Sunamganj respectively.This is the first base line study for genetic detection of 2019-nCoV in Mymensingh division which may reflect the total scenario of Bangladesh situation.We hope this paper will help the researcher to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing throughout the world in this crisis moment. Serological diagnostic of the severe respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a valuable tool for the determination of immunity and surveillance of exposure to the virus.In the context of an ongoing pandemic, it is essential to externally validate widely used tests to assure correct diagnostics and epidemiological estimations.We evaluated the performance of the COVID-19 ELISA IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgM/A (Vircell, S.L.)against a highly specific and sensitive in-house Luminex immunoassay in a set of samples from pregnant women and cord blood.The agreement between both assays was moderate to high for IgG but low for IgM/A.Considering seropositivity by either IgG and/or IgM/A, the technical performance of the ELISA was highly imbalanced, with 96% sensitivity at the expense of 22% specificity.As for the clinical performance, the negative predictive value reached 87% while the positive predictive value was 51%.Our results stress the need for highly specific and sensitive assays and external validation of diagnostic tests with different sets of samples to avoid the clinical, epidemiological and personal disturbances derived from serological misdiagnosis. There is currently a high level of demand for rapid COVID-19 tests, that can detect the onset of the disease at point of care settings.We have developed an ultra-portable, self-contained, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection, based on the principle of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).The LAMP assay is 100% sensitive and specific to detect a minimum of 300 RNA copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2.All of the required sample transportation, lysing and amplification steps are performed in a standalone disposable cartridge, which is controlled by a battery operated, pocket size (6x9x4cm3) unit.The test is easy to operate and does not require skilled personnel.The total time from sample to answer is approximately 35 min; a colorimetric readout indicates positive or negative results.This portable diagnostic platform has significant potential for rapid and effective testing in community settings.This will accelerate clinical decision making, in terms of effective triage and timely therapeutic and infection control interventions. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of BNT162b2 among HCWs of a university hospital while a recrudescence of pandemics was hitting the province, with a high rate of the B.1.1.7 variant.Methods: The study was performed in the context of health surveillance at the workplaces.We monitored the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs classified by having received the entire vaccine schedule or not; the latter further classified in not vaccinated workers and workers who had received the first shot more than 14 days earlier.The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs.The cumulative incidence of infections in the period was normalised to 100,000 people.Results: At the end of the observation period, HCWs that had completed the full schedule were at lower infection risk than both unvaccinated HCWs and the workforce who had not yet gained the complete theoretical protection from the vaccine (by 2.4-folds).Overall, ninety-two SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed among HCWs, mostly among not protected workers (52 cases) but none of them showed symptoms requiring hospitalisation.Conclusions: The vaccination campaign effectively reduced the appearance of symptoms and the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs.Among vaccinated HCWs, gene sequencing was possible in five cases only, 4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants.The high rate of unsuccessful gene sequencing observed among infected vaccinated workers could be explained by a low viral burden.Vaccination for COVID-19 should be mandatory in occupational settings with a high infective risk. Peripheral blood lymphocyte count is shown to be decreased in patients with COVID-19 in the early stage of the disease.The degree of lymphocyte count reduction is related to COVID-19 severity and could be used as an indicator to reflect the disease severity.Our aim was to investigate the value of lymphocyte count in determining COVID-19 severity and estimating the time for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results to turn negative.We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 201 patients with severe and critical COVID-19.The patients were admitted to the West Campus of Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.The data included age, gender, chronic disease, lymphocyte count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results.The age of patients in critically ill group was higher than in severely ill group (p = 0.019).The lymphocyte count of critically ill patients was lower than of severely ill patients.The cutoff value of lymphocyte count to distinguish between the critically ill and the severely ill was 0.735 109/L (p = 0.001).The cutoff value of lymphocyte count for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results turning negative in severely and critically ill patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease) was 0.835 109/L (p = 0.017).The cutoff value of lymphocyte count for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results turning negative in severely and critically ill male patients was 0.835 109/L (p < 0.0001).Lymphocyte count could be an effective indicator to predict COVID-19 severity.It may also be useful in determining the time for nucleic acid test results to turn negative in COVID-19 patients with underlying chronic diseases or male COVID-19 patients with severe and critical conditions. Aims To review the evidence regarding the possibility of fetal vertical transmission in COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers by diagnosing through placental swabs.Methods The search terms pregnant COVID-19 positive mothers, fetal vertical transmission and placental swabs were used.20 papers were selected.Results 183 COVID-19 positive pregnant women were identified whose 184 placentas and 185 neonates were also analysed by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (one case of monochorionic diamniotic twins and one case of dichorionic diamniotic twins).183 liveborn neonates were successfully delivered primarily via caesarean section (99%).2 mothers did not deliver liveborn infants due to severe preeclampsia resulting in a termination of pregnancy and a miscarriage, both occurring in the second trimester.9 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (5%).We report no neonatal mortality after live birth and no maternal mortality.17 placentas tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 out of a total of 184 tested (9%).Of these 17, 7 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in the maternal, neonatal and placental tissue.Conclusion There is no concrete evidence of vertical transmission occurring between mother and infant.We propose further research investigating the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women by using RT-PCR to test the mother, placenta, vaginal fluid, breast milk and infant for SARS-CoV-2 at various stages of transmission. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a significant threat to global health security.Till date, no completely effective drug or vaccine is available to cure COVID-19.Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed.This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2.Seven highly antigenic proteins of SARS-COV-2 were selected as targets and different epitopes (B-cell and T-cell) were predicted.Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted.Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.93% coverage of the worlds population.Hence, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting 16 MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant.MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible.Furthermore, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8.Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression.Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19.However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated. Nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS) coupled with RT-PCR is the current gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections.However, numerous studies have recently demonstrated the advantages of alternative nasal specimen collection approaches over NPS specifically for COVID-19 diagnosis.The present review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and summarises the current literature to give a clear overview of nasal specimen collection methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection.Publications investigating NPS and at least one other form of nasal specimen collection in combination with RT-PCR for viral detection in the context of COVID-19 were assessed.We identified 425 articles and ultimately included 18 studies in this systematic review.The suitable publications evaluated different forms of nasal specimen collection, with anterior nasal swabbing (ANS) and midturbinate swabbing (MTS) being the most frequently examined techniques.The analysed studies report sensitivity and specificity results (67.5-96.2% and 97.9-100.0%, respectively) similar to those achieved via NPS, especially in the early stages of disease or when paired with an oropharyngeal swab.Results from these studies suggest that ANS and MTS are suitable alternatives to NPS for COVID-19 testing.Due to their ease of collection, ANS and MTS collection techniques may facilitate broader testing strategies and allow for economization of medical staff. There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under control.Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association that the virus will establish with the human population and, in particular, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease.Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated.Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fuelled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection and re-entries from zoonotic reservoirs.Here we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity.Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2.There are key pieces of data that are urgently needed in order to make good decisions; we outline these and propose a way forward. BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; BioNTech and Pfizer) is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine for the prevention of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.BNT162b2 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the expression of which elicits immune responses against the antigen in recipients.In early December 2020, BNT162b2 received a temporary emergency use authorization (EUA) in the UK and, subsequently, a series of approvals or authorizations for emergency use in Bahrain, Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the USA.Soon after, BNT162b2 received conditional marketing authorizations in Switzerland (19 December 2020) and the EU (21 December 2020) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older.BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly in a two-dose regimen.This article summarizes the milestones in the development of BNT162b2 leading to these first approvals for the prevention of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged institutions diagnostic processes worldwide.The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software tool that automatically evaluates chest computed tomography for findings of suspected COVID-19.Two groups were retrospectively evaluated for COVID-19-associated ground glass opacities of the lungs (group A: real-time polymerase chain reaction positive COVID patients, n = 108; group B: asymptomatic pre-operative group, n = 88).The performance of an AI-based software assessment tool for detection of COVID-associated abnormalities was compared with human evaluation based on COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scores performed by 3 readers.All evaluated variables of the AI-based assessment showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P < .01).The inter-reader reliability of CO-RADS scoring was 0.87.The CO-RADS scores were substantially higher in group A (mean 4.28) than group B (mean 1.50).The difference between CO-RADS scoring and AI assessment was statistically significant for all variables but showed good correlation with the clinical context of the CO-RADS score.AI allowed to predict COVID positive cases with an accuracy of 0.94.The evaluated AI-based algorithm detects COVID-19-associated findings with high sensitivity and may support radiologic workflows during the pandemic. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 is an approved adenovirus-based vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) currently being deployed globally.Previous studies in rhesus macaques revealed that intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 provided protection against pneumonia but did not reduce shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from the upper respiratory tract.Here, we investigated whether intranasally administered ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces detection of virus in nasal swabs after challenging vaccinated macaques and hamsters with SARS-CoV-2 carrying a D614G mutation in the spike protein.Viral loads in swabs obtained from intranasally vaccinated hamsters were decreased compared to control hamsters, and no viral RNA or infectious virus was found in lung tissue after a direct challenge or after direct contact with infected hamsters.Intranasal vaccination of rhesus macaques resulted in reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs and a reduction in viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and lower respiratory tract tissue.Intranasal vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 reduced virus concentrations in nasal swabs in two different SARS-CoV-2 animal models, warranting further investigation as a potential vaccination route for COVID-19 vaccines. In less than one year since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, were granted the first historic authorization for emergency use, while another mRNA vaccine, CVnCoV, progressed to phase 3 clinical testing.The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccine products, which consist of synthetic mRNA strands encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells.This review digs deeper into the scientific breakthroughs of the last decades that laid the foundations for the rapid rise of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.As well as providing momentum for mRNA vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 represents an ideal case study allowing to compare design-activity differences between the different mRNA vaccine candidates.Therefore, a detailed overview of the composition and (pre)clinical performance of the three most advanced mRNA vaccines is provided and the influence of choices in their structural design on to their immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile is discussed in depth.In addition to the new fundamental insights in the mRNA vaccines mode of action highlighted here, we also point out which unknowns remain that require further investigation and possibly, optimization in future mRNA vaccine development. The Dutch test capacity to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased enormously since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.As a consequence of ongoing spreading of the virus, tests are also increasingly being carried out among people without COVID-19 related symptoms.Preventive testing for SARS-CoV-2 is especially performed in sectors in which early detection of the virus is essential, for instance in the professional sports sector.The guideline of the RIVM states that people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but without COVID-19 related symptoms are advised to stay in isolation for five days from time of the test.However, this guideline is not suitable for people who are diagnosed in a very early stage of the infection as a result of preventive testing.They are likely to leave isolation during the most contagious phase of the infection.In this paper, we argue that people who are positive for SARS-CoV-2, but without COVID-19 related symptoms, after a preventive test should be advised to isolate longer than five days. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with mutations in key antibody epitopes has raised concerns that antigenic evolution could erode adaptive immunity elicited by prior infection or vaccination.The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection.To investigate how human antibody responses to vaccines are influenced by viral mutations, we used deep mutational scanning to compare the specificity of polyclonal antibodies elicited by either two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine or natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more targeted to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to antibodies elicited by natural infection.However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more broadly distributed across epitopes compared to infection-elicited antibodies.This greater binding breadth means that single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera compared to convalescent sera.Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by natural infection or different modes of vaccination may have a differing susceptibility to erosion by SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Quick identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic.Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis.However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing.While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive.To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples.We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample.We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools.With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively.Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively.These observations led us to conclude that 4-sample pool testing offers the optimal blend of resource optimization and diagnostic performance across difference disease prevalence settings. Vaccination is one of the most significant inventions in medicine.Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogens genome(s).To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning.Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components.The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML.The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools.Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results.Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis.Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens.As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19.The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design.Vaxign2 is publicly accessible at http://www.violinet.org/vaxign2. The global demand for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently far outweighs the available global supply and manufacturing capacity.As a result, securing doses of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries has been challenging, particularly for African countries.Clinical trial investigation for COVID-19 vaccines has been rare in Africa, with the only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for COVID-19 vaccines having been conducted in South Africa.In addition to addressing the current inequities in the vaccine roll-out for low- and middle-income countries, there is a need to monitor the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in these regions.Although RCTs are the superior method for evaluating vaccine efficacy, the feasibility of conducting RCTs to monitor COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness during mass vaccine campaigns will likely be low.There is still a need to evaluate the effectiveness of mass COVID-19 vaccine distribution in a practical manner.We discuss how target trial emulation, the application of trial design principles from RCTs to the analysis of observational data, can be used as a practical, cost-effective way to evaluate real-world effectiveness for COVID-19 vaccines.There are several study design considerations that need to be made in the analyses of observational data, such as uncontrolled confounders and selection biases.Target trial emulation accounts for these considerations to improve the analyses of observational data.The framework of target trial emulation provides a practical way to monitor the effectiveness of mass vaccine campaigns for COVID-19 using observational data. The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic causing significant damage to public health and the economy.Efforts to understand the mechanisms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by the lack of robust mouse models.To overcome this barrier, we used a reverse genetic system to generate a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2.Incorporating key mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants, this model recapitulates critical elements of human infection including viral replication in the lung, immune cell infiltration, and significant in vivo disease.Importantly, mouse adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 does not impair replication in human airway cells and maintains antigenicity similar to human SARS-CoV-2 strains.Coupled with the incorporation of mutations found in variants of concern, CMA3p20 offers several advantages over other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains.Using this model, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are protected from lethal challenge with the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting immunity from heterologous Coronavirus (CoV) strains.Together, the results highlight the use of this mouse model for further study of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. Serological tests for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Abs in blood are expected to identify individuals who have acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and indication of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Many serological tests have been developed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2.However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined.This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various Ag-specific Ab isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via PCR test.We developed IgG, IgM, and IgA measurement assays for each Ag, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full-length S protein, S trimer, and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on ELISA.The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, whereas the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity.The sensitivity of all Ag-specific Ab isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 d postsymptom onset.The best correlation with virus-neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD, and levels of IgG against RBD in sera from four patients with severe COVID-19 increased concordantly with neutralizing activity.Our results provide valuable information regarding the selection of serological test for seroprevalence and vaccine evaluation studies. The use of health information technology (HIT) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly increased.During the pandemic, HIT has been used to provide telehealth services, education on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease, updates on epidemiology and treatments, and most recently, access to scheduling systems for the COVID-19 vaccines.Disparities and health equity, with higher rates of illness, hospitalization, and death, during the pandemic has been documented in Hispanic or Latinx, black, and Native American or Alaska Native persons.Social determinants of health affect these persons disproportionately, including having lower socioeconomic status, lack of reliable transportation, lack of good quality broadband, being employed as an "essential worker," lack of quality housing, and access to and distrust of the government and health care setting.Patients who have limited or low health literacy will also be at risk for inequitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine owing to the complexities associated with the current vaccine distribution models and the heavy reliance on HIT. Reliable, inexpensive, and rapid diagnostic tools are essential to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.Many commercial kits for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have played a crucial role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Most current standard in vitro diagnostic (IVD) protocols for infectious diseases are sensitive but time-consuming and require sophisticated laboratory equipment and specially trained personnel.Recent advances in biosensor technology suggest the potential to deliver point-of-care (POC) diagnostics that are affordable and provide accurate results in a short time.The ideal "sample-in-answer-out" type fully integrated POC infection diagnostic platforms are expected to be autonomous or easy-to-operate, equipment-free or infrastructure-independent, and high-throughput or easy to upscale.In this Account, we detail the recent progress made by our group and others in the development of centrifugal microfluidic devices or lab-on-a-disc (LOAD) systems.Unlike conventional pump-based fluid actuation, the centrifugal force generated by spinning the disc induces liquid pumping and no external fluidic interconnects are required.This allows a total fluidic network required for multiple steps of biological assays to be integrated on a disc, enabling fully automated POC diagnostics.Various applications have been demonstrated, including liquid biopsy for personalized cancer management, food applications, and environmental monitoring; here, we focus on IVD for infectious disease.First, we introduce various on-disc unit operation technologies, including reagent storage, sedimentation, filtration, valving, decanting, aliquoting, mixing, separation, serial dilution, washing, and calibration.Such centrifugal microfluidic technologies have already proved promising for micro-total-analysis systems for automated IVD ranging from molecular detection of pathogens to multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that use raw samples such as whole blood or saliva.Some recent examples of LOAD systems for molecular diagnostics in which some or all steps of the assays are integrated on a disc, including pathogen enrichment, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection, are discussed in detail.We then introduce fully automated ELISA systems with enhanced sensitivity.Furthermore, we demonstrate a toy-inspired fidget spinner that enables electricity-free and rapid analysis of pathogens from undiluted urine samples of patients with urinary tract infection symptoms and a phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility test for an extreme POC diagnostics application.Considering the urgent need for cost-effective and reliable POC infection diagnostic tools, especially in the current pandemic crisis, the current limitations and future directions of fast and broad adaptation in real-world settings are also discussed.With proper attention to key challenges and leverage with recent advances in bio-sensing technologies, molecular biology, nanomaterials, analytical chemistry, miniaturization, system integration, and data management, LOAD systems hold the potential to deliver POC infection diagnostic tools with unprecedented performance regarding time, accuracy, and cost.We hope the new insight and promise of LOAD systems for POC infection diagnostics presented in this Account can spark new ideas and inspire further research and development to create better healthcare systems for current and future pandemics. Effective, sensitive, and reliable diagnostic reagents are of paramount importance for combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when there is neither a preventive vaccine nor a specific drug available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It will cause a large number of false-positive and false-negative tests if currently used diagnostic reagents are undermined.Based on genotyping of 31,421 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples collected up to July 23, 2020, we reveal that essentially all of the current COVID-19 diagnostic targets have undergone mutations.We further show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most mutations on the targets of various nucleocapsid (N) gene primers and probes, which have been widely used around the world to diagnose COVID-19.To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 genes have mutated unevenly, we have computed the mutation rate and mutation h-index of all SARS-CoV-2 genes, indicating that the N gene is one of the most non-conservative genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.We show that due to human immune response induced APOBEC mRNA (C > T) editing, diagnostic targets should also be selected to avoid cytidines.Our findings might enable optimally selecting the conservative SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins for the design and development of COVID-19 diagnostic reagents, prophylactic vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.AVAILABILITY: Interactive real-time online Mutation Tracker. Studies on the real-life effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention are urgently needed.In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021.We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020.To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities.A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization.This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities.Our analysis demonstrates the real-life effect of a national vaccination campaign on the pandemic dynamics. In an unprecedented collaborative effort, basic and clinical scientists have provided us with an effective COVID-19 vaccine within less than one year after SARS CoV-2 emergence.Virus or vaccine induced immunity may offer different degrees of protection against infection, transmission and pathology (disease).Immunity decides on the outcome of COVID-19, both at an individual as well as a population level.In this literature analysis, emphasis is put first on the gold standard for evaluating human antiviral immunity: data from high quality, well-designed trials centered on patient outcome as clinical endpoint (morbidity, e. g. severe COVID-19).Next, case reports or case series on humans with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) may provide unique insights into human CoV-2 immunity.Surrogate markers in blood (e. g. antibody titers) are extensively employed for the evaluation of SARS CoV-2 immunity, but are not useful.SARS CoV-2 antibody titers neither indicate local immunity in the nasopharynx/respiratory tract nor do they reliably reflect systemic immunity.Systemic and tissue resident SARS CoV-2 specific effector and memory T-cells are key to immunity but cannot routinely be measured in blood.Based largely on clinical data, this literature analysis suggests that antiviral immunity against Coronaviruses including SARS CoV-2 is waning significantly over time regarding infection and transmission protection.However, in individuals who have recovered from infections with human Coronaviruses (including SARS CoV-2) or been vaccinated against SARS CoV-2, immunity is robust in its most critical quality: protection against pathology/severe disease.Thus, immunologists see the glass half-full and envisage the transition of COVID-19 from an epidemic to an endemic state with semiannual peaks of incidence but, most importantly, protection from severe COVID-19 or death in the vast majority of individuals (as observed in other human Coronavirus infections). Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viral pathogens that infect both birds and mammals, including humans.Seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been recognized so far.HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1 account for one-third of common colds with mild symptoms.The other three members are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.These viruses are responsible for SARS, MERS, and CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.A variety of diagnostic techniques, including chest X-rays, computer tomography (CT) scans, analysis of viral nucleic acids, proteins, or whole virions, and host antibody detection using serological assays have been developed for the detection of these viruses.In this review, we discuss conventional serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot (WB), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), as well as biosensor-based assays that have been developed for diagnosing HCoV-associated diseases since 2003, with an in-depth focus on COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on societies and economies worldwide.There remains an ongoing need for high-performance SARS-CoV-2 tests which may be broadly deployed for infection monitoring.Here we report a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay in development for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood and saliva.In all matrices in the studies conducted to date we observe >98% negative percent agreement and >90% positive percent agreement with molecular testing for days 1-7 in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals.N-protein load decreases as anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG increases, and N-protein levels correlate with RT-PCR Ct-values in saliva, and between matched saliva and capillary blood samples.This Simoa SARS-CoV-2 N-protein assay effectively detects SARS-CoV-2 infection via measurement of antigen levels in blood or saliva, using non-invasive, swab-independent collection methods, offering potential for at home and point of care sample collection. SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, causing high mortality and unprecedented restrictions on social and economic activity.Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures.Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks.By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries.OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes.It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference.The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency.A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results.Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19.Clinicians should consider a tests characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results.Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity.However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results.Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patients exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis.Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the tests sensitivity and specificity.A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the tests sensitivity.A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity.Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures. The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health concern globally posing a significant threat to human health and economy and creating an unprecedented crisis in all spheres of the global life.Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment.There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies.Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models.In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies.Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets.This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV.A detailed knowledge may pave the way to combat this pandemic COVID-19 as well as prevent similar deadly epidemics in future. Due to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control.It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses.Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries.Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan.Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed.On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number.These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation.When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss. Fast, accurate, and reliable diagnostic tests are critical for controlling the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.The current gold standard for testing is real-time PCR; however, during the current pandemic, supplies of testing kits and reagents have been limited.We report the validation of a rapid (30 minutes), user-friendly, and accurate microchip real-time PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab RNA extracts.Microchips preloaded with COVID-19 primers and probes for the N gene accommodate 1.2-L reaction volumes, lowering the required reagents by 10-fold compared with tube-based real-time PCR.We validated our assay using contrived reference samples and 21 clinical samples from patients in Canada, determining a limit of detection of 1 copy per reaction.The microchip real-time PCR provides a significantly lower resource alternative to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved real-time RT-PCR assays with comparable sensitivity, showing 100% positive and negative predictive agreement of clinical samples. Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with increased transmissibility and occasionally reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibody activity induced by past ancestry virus infection or current COVID-19 vaccines.Nevertheless, COVID-19 vaccines have consistently demonstrated high efficacy and effectiveness against COVID-19 severe disease, hospitalisation and death, including disease caused by designated variants of concern.In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines are more heterogeneous in reducing the risk of infection and mild COVID19, and are modestly effective in interrupting virus transmission.Ongoing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 resulting in increased transmissibility and relative evasion of neutralising antibody activity induced by past virus infection or COVID-19 vaccines are likely.The duration of protection induced by COVID-19 vaccines is modelled to be relatively short in protecting against infection and mild COVID-19, but is likely to be 2 - 3 years against severe disease.Current experience from the UK and Israel demonstrates that even with high levels of COVID19 vaccine coverage (&gt;85% of the adult population), resurgences with new variants of concern remain a strong probability.Nevertheless, such resurgences are not mirrored by high rates of hospitalisation and death compared with what was experienced in relatively COVID-19 vaccine-naive populations.Even though COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to result in a herd immunity state, their ability to protect against severe COVID-19 and death could allow for a return to normalcy once a large enough proportion of the adult population in a country has been vaccinated. Risk perception and risk averting behaviors of public agencies in the emergence and spread of COVID-19 can be retrieved through online social media (Twitter), and such interactions can be echoed in other information outlets.This study collected time-sensitive online social media data and analyzed patterns of health risk communication of public health and emergency agencies in the emergence and spread of novel coronavirus using data-driven methods.The major focus is toward understanding how policy-making agencies communicate risk and response information through social media during a pandemic and influence community response-ie, timing of lockdown, timing of reopening, etc.-and disease outbreak indicators-ie, number of confirmed cases and number of deaths.Twitter data of six major public organizations (1,000-4,500 tweets per organization) are collected from February 21, 2020 to June 6, 2020.Several machine learning algorithms, including dynamic topic model and sentiment analysis, are applied over time to identify the topic dynamics over the specific timeline of the pandemic.Organizations emphasized on various topics-eg, importance of wearing face mask, home quarantine, understanding the symptoms, social distancing and contact tracing, emerging community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing and medical supplies, effect of tobacco, pandemic stress management, increasing hospitalization rate, upcoming hurricane season, use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment, maintaining hygiene, and the role of healthcare podcast in different timeline.The findings can benefit emergency management, policymakers, and public health agencies to identify targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how local, federal, and international agencies reacted to COVID-19. Nursing home and long-term care facility residents live in congregate settings and are often elderly and frail, putting them at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; therefore, this population was prioritized for early vaccination in the United States (1).Following rapid distribution and administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (2), observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness (VE) ranging from 53% to 92% against SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-6).However, concerns about the potential for waning vaccine-induced immunity and the recent emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant highlight the need to continue to monitor VE (7).Weekly data reported by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare (CMS)-certified skilled nursing facilities or nursing homes to CDCs National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) were analyzed to evaluate effectiveness of full vaccination (2 doses received 14 days earlier) with any of the two currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the period soon after vaccine introduction and before the Delta variant was circulating (pre-Delta [March 1-May 9, 2021]), and when the Delta variant predominated (Delta [June 21-August 1, 2021]).Using 17,407 weekly reports from 3,862 facilities from the pre-Delta period, adjusted effectiveness against infection for any mRNA vaccine was 74.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70.0%-78.8%).Analysis using 33,160 weekly reports from 11,581 facilities during an intermediate period (May 10-June 20) found that the adjusted effectiveness was 67.5% (95% CI = 60.1%-73.5%).Analysis using 85,593 weekly reports from 14,917 facilities during the Delta period found that the adjusted effectiveness was 53.1% (95% CI = 49.1%-56.7%).Effectiveness estimates were similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.These findings indicate that mRNA vaccines provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents; however, VE was lower after the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the United States.This analysis assessed VE against any infection, without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations.Additional evaluations are needed to understand protection against severe disease in nursing home residents over time.Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies, including infection control, testing, and vaccination of nursing home staff members, residents, and visitors, are critical.An additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents to optimize a protective immune response. As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into its second year, there is hope on the horizon, in the form of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which promise disease suppression and a return to pre-pandemic normalcy.In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis.Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality.Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of coronavirus (known as COVID-19), the virus causing the current pandemic.There are ongoing research studies to develop effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 using various methods and many results have been published.The structure-based drug design of SARS-CoV-2-related proteins is promising, however, reliable information regarding the structural and intra- and intermolecular interactions is required.We have conducted studies based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method for calculating the electronic structures of protein complexes and analyzing their quantitative molecular interactions.This enables us to extensively analyze the molecular interactions in residues or functional group units acting inside the protein complexes.Such precise interaction data are available in the FMO database (FMODB) (https://drugdesign.riken.jp/FMODB/).Since April 2020, we have performed several FMO calculations on the structures of SARS-CoV-2-related proteins registered in the Protein Data Bank.We have published the results of 681 structures, including three structural proteins and 11 nonstructural proteins, on the COVID-19 special page (as of June 8, 2021).In this paper, we describe the entire COVID-19 special page of the FMODB and discuss the calculation results for various proteins.These data not only aid the interpretation of experimentally determined structures but also the understanding of protein functions, which is useful for rational drug design for COVID-19. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for two mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, mRNA-based technology has attracted broad attention from the scientific community to investors.When delivered intracellularly, mRNA has the ability to produce various therapeutic proteins, enabling the treatment of a variety of illnesses, including but not limited to infectious diseases, cancers, and genetic diseases.Accordingly, mRNA holds significant therapeutic potential and provides a promising means to target historically hard-to-treat diseases.Current clinical efforts harnessing mRNA-based technology are focused on vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, protein replacement therapy, and genome editing.The clinical translation of mRNA-based technology has been made possible by leveraging nanoparticle delivery methods.However, the application of mRNA for therapeutic purposes is still challenged by the need for specific, efficient, and safe delivery systems.This Account highlights key advances in designing and developing combinatorial synthetic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with distinct chemical structures and properties for in vitro and in vivo intracellular mRNA delivery.LNPs represent the most advanced nonviral nanoparticle delivery systems that have been extensively investigated for nucleic acid delivery.The aforementioned COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and one LNP-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug (ONPATTRO) have received clinical approval from the FDA, highlighting the success of synthetic ionizable lipids for in vivo nucleic acid delivery.In this Account, we first summarize the research efforts from our group on the development of bioreducible and biodegradable LNPs by leveraging the combinatorial chemistry strategy, such as the Michael addition reaction, which allows us to easily generate a large set of lipidoids with diverse chemical structures.Next, we discuss the utilization of a library screening strategy to identify optimal LNPs for targeted mRNA delivery and showcase the applications of the optimized LNPs in cell engineering and genome editing.Finally, we outline key challenges to the clinical translation of mRNA-based therapies and propose an outlook for future directions of the chemical design and optimization of LNPs to improve the safety and specificity of mRNA drugs.We hope this Account provides insight into the rational design of LNPs for facilitating the development of mRNA therapeutics, a transformative technology that promises to revolutionize future medicine. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides an effective tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.Here, we combined antigen optimization and nanoparticle display to develop vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2.We first displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on three self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system.We then identified heptad repeat 2 (HR2) in S2 as the cause of spike metastability, designed an HR2-deleted glycine-capped spike (S2GHR2), and displayed S2GHR2 on SApNPs.An antibody column specific for the RBD enabled tag-free vaccine purification.In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P).S2GHR2 elicited twofold higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2GHR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers.The S2GHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP also induced critically needed T cell immunity, thereby providing a promising vaccine candidate. The positivity rate of testing is currently used both as a benchmark of testing adequacy and for assessing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.However, since the former is a prerequisite for the latter, its interpretation is often conflicting.We propose as a benchmark for COVID-19 testing effectiveness a new metric, termed Severity Detection Rate (SDR), that represents the daily needs for new Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, per 100 cases detected (t - i) days ago, per 10,000 tests performed (t - i) days ago.Based on the announced COVID-19 monitoring data in Greece from May 2020 until August 2021, we show that beyond a certain threshold of daily tests, SDR reaches a plateau of very low variability that begins to reflect testing adequacy.Due to the stabilization of SDR, it was possible to predict with great accuracy the daily needs for new ICU admissions, 12 days ahead of each testing data point, over a period of 10 months, with Pearson r = 0.98 (p = 10-197), RMSE = 7.16.We strongly believe that this metric will help guide the timely decisions of both scientists and government officials to tackle pandemic spread and prevent ICU overload by setting effective testing requirements for accurate pandemic monitoring.We propose further study of this novel metric with data from more countries to confirm the validity of the current findings. The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a huge threat to global health and economy.Countermeasures have revolutionized norms for working, socializing, learning, and travel.Importantly, vaccines have been considered as most effective tools to combat with COVID-19.As of the beginning of 2021, >200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates, covering nearly all existing technologies and platforms, are being research and development (R&D) by multiple manufacturers worldwide.This has posed a huge obstacle to the quality control and evaluation of those candidate vaccines, especially in China, where five vaccine platforms are deployed in parallel.To accelerate the R&D progress of COVID-19 vaccines, the guidances on R&D of COVID-19 vaccine have been issued by National Regulatory Authorities or organizations worldwide.The Center for Drug Evaluation and national quality control laboratory in China have played a leading role in launching the research on quality control and evaluation in collaboration with relevant laboratories involved in the vaccine R&D, which greatly supported the progression of vaccines R&D, and accelerated the approval for emergency use and conditional marketing of currently vaccine candidates.In this paper, the progress and experience gained in quality control and evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines developed in China are summarized, which might provide references for the R&D of current and next generation of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. Data sources The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, European Medicines Agency (EMA)/European Commission and UKs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Study selection Product monographs, product information and consumer medicine information for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines.Data extraction and synthesis Reported side/adverse/undesirable effects concerning the orofacial region were extracted and tabulated.Results There were rare reports of adverse events affecting the orofacial region for both vaccines in their pertaining documents, including acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bells palsy), facial swelling and swelling of the lips, face or tongue associated with anaphylaxis.There was heterogeneity in the acknowledgement of vaccine-related adverse events in North America compared with Europe.Conclusions There are rare reports of orofacial adverse effects of two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in their documents; however, there are inconsistencies in the description of these adverse effects in different countries. To respond to the urgent need for COVID-19 testing, countries perform nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in centralized laboratories.Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction), used to amplify and detect the viral RNA., is considered, as the current gold standard for diagnostics.It is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings [1].In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in isothermal amplification and paper microfluidics, we created a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT-LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or fluorescent probes.Depending on the viral load in the tested samples, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour.Using a set of 16 pools of naso-pharyngal swab eluates, we estimated a limit of detection comparable to real-time RT-PCR (i.e.1 genome copies per microliter of clinical sample) and no cross-reaction with eight major respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe.We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called "COVIDISC" to carry out the test at the point of care.The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment will expedite the widespread dissemination of this device.What is proposed here is a new efficient tool to help managing the pandemics. Rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is a cornerstone for the control of virus spread.The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR is similar in saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs.Rapid molecular point-of-care tests in saliva could facilitate, broaden and speed up the diagnosis.We conducted a prospective study in two community COVID-19 screening centers to evaluate the performances of a CE-marked RT-LAMP assay (EasyCoV) designed for the detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA from fresh saliva samples, compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, to saliva RT-PCR and to nasopharyngeal antigen testing.Overall, 117 of the 1718 participants (7%) tested positive with nasopharyngeal RT-PCR.Compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay in saliva were 34% and 97%, respectively.The Ct values of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR were significantly lower in the 40 true positive subjects with saliva RT-LAMP (Ct 25.9) than in the 48 false negative subjects with saliva RT-LAMP (Ct 28.4) (p = 0.028).Considering six alternate criteria for reference tests, including saliva RT-PCR and nasopharyngeal antigen, the sensitivity of saliva RT-LAMP ranged between 27 and 44%.The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in crude saliva samples with an RT-LAMP assay had a lower sensitivity than nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, saliva RT-PCR and nasopharyngeal antigen testing.Registration number: NCT04578509. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources.Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance.Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification.We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM).In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction.We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA.Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input.More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine. The extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the United States population is currently unknown.High quality serology is key to avoiding medically costly diagnostic errors, as well as to assuring properly informed public health decisions.Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol, from antigen production to data analyses, that helps define thresholds for IgG and IgM seropositivity with high specificities.Validation of this protocol is performed using traditionally collected serum as well as dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits.Archival (pre-2019) samples are used as negative controls, and convalescent, PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 patient samples serve as positive controls.Using this protocol, minimal cross-reactivity is observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses, and no cross reactivity is observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI.Our protocol may thus help provide standardized, population-based data on the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, immunity and infection. The rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has propelled the rapid development of serologic tests that can detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.These have been used for studying the prevalence and spread of infection in different populations, and helping establish a recent diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and will likely be used to confirm humoral immunity after infection or vaccination.However, nearly all lab-based high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays require a serum sample from venous blood draw, limiting their applications and scalability.Here, we present a method that enables large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serologic studies by combining self or office collection of fingerprick blood with a volumetric absorptive microsampling device (Mitra, Neoteryx LLC) with a high-throughput electrochemiluminescence-based SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay (Roche Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics Inc) that is emergency use authorization approved for use on serum samples and widely used by clinical laboratories around the world.We found that the Roche Elecsys assay has a high dynamic range that allows for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples diluted 1:20 as well as contrived dried blood extracts.Extracts of dried blood from Mitra devices acquired in a community seroprevalence study showed near identical sensitivity and specificity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with neat sera using predefined thresholds for each specimen type.Overall, this study affirms the use of Mitra dried blood collection device with the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay for remote or at-home testing as well as large-scale community seroprevalence studies. BACKGROUND It is unknown if the efficacy of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccine is affected by the co-administration of other vaccines.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shifted their recommendations recently, allowing for the co-administration of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines.This is based on the experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines, where the immunogenicity and adverse event profiles were generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously or alone.CASE REPORT We present a case of a 29-year-old Asian woman who received the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at around the same time.BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and Tdap vaccine were administered into the deltoid region of the left arm and right arm, respectively.We then monitored for immunogenicity.We observed a delay in the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1) protein antibodies at around 8 weeks after the second dose.CONCLUSIONS Unless warranted, it is important to adhere to current CDC recommendations with regards to the co-administration of vaccines.Although the administration of Tdap with COVID-19 vaccine in our case caused delay in immunogenicity, it did not negate the ability of the BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine to elicit an adequate immune response.The reason for delay in immune response with co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines is unknown and further studies are needed. Many kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools offering in-person learning have adopted strategies to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1).These measures include mandating use of face masks, physical distancing in classrooms, increasing ventilation with outdoor air, identification of close contacts,* and following CDC isolation and quarantine guidance (2).A 2-week pilot investigation was conducted to investigate occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission in K-12 schools in the city of Springfield, Missouri, and in St. Louis County, Missouri, during December 7-18, 2020.Schools in both locations implemented COVID-19 mitigation strategies; however, Springfield implemented a modified quarantine policy permitting student close contacts aged 18 years who had school-associated contact with a person with COVID-19 and met masking requirements during their exposure to continue in-person learning.Participating students, teachers, and staff members with COVID-19 (37) from 22 schools and their school-based close contacts (contacts) (156) were interviewed, and contacts were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing.Among 102 school-based contacts who received testing, two (2%) had positive test results indicating probable school-based SARS-CoV-2 secondary transmission.Both contacts were in Springfield and did not meet criteria to participate in the modified quarantine.In Springfield, 42 student contacts were permitted to continue in-person learning under the modified quarantine; among the 30 who were interviewed, 21 were tested, and none received a positive test result.Despite high community transmission, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies was lower than that in the community.Until additional data are available, K-12 schools should continue implementing CDC-recommended mitigation measures (2) and follow CDC isolation and quarantine guidance to minimize secondary transmission in schools offering in-person learning. We quantified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air of different hospital settings and the autopsy room of the largest medical centre in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to determine the presence of the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the nucleocapsid protein genes.The E-gene was detected in 5 out of 6 samples at the ICU-COVID-19 ward and in 5 out of 7 samples at the ward-COVID-19.Similarly, in the non-dedicated facilities, the E-gene was detected in 5 out of 6 samples collected in the ICU and 4 out of 7 samples in the ward.In the necropsy room, 6 out of 7 samples were positive for the E-gene.When both wards were compared, the non-COVID ward presented a significantly higher concentration of the E-gene than in the COVID-19 ward (p = 0.003).There was no significant difference in E-gene concentration between the ICU-COVID-19 and the ICU (p = 0.548).Likewise, there was no significant difference among E-gene concentrations found in the autopsy room versus the ICUs and wards (dedicated or not) (p = 0.245).Our results show the widespread presence of aerosol contamination in different hospital units. The outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a worldwide threat to public health.COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop clinical symptoms that are often confused with the infections of other respiratory pathogens.Sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to discriminate from other viruses is urgently needed for COVID-19 diagnosis.Herein, we streamlined a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection platform, termed Cas12a-linked beam unlocking reaction (CALIBURN).We show that CALIBURN could detect SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and influenza viruses with little cross-reactivity.Importantly, CALIBURN allowed accurate diagnosis of clinical samples with extremely low viral loads, which is a major obstacle for the clinical applications of existing CRISPR diagnostic platforms.When tested on the specimens from SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative donors, CALIBURN exhibited 73.0% positive and 19.0% presumptive positive rates and 100% specificity.Moreover, unlike existing CRISPR detection methods that were mainly restricted to respiratory specimens, CALIBURN displayed consistent performance across both respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens, suggesting its broad specimen compatibility.Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrated that CALIBURN allowed detection of coexisting pathogens without cross-reactivity from a single tissue specimen.Our results suggest that CALIBURN can serve as a versatile platform for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe morbidity and mortality following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading some countries to recommend vaccination of pregnant women against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).These recommendations are based on studies conducted early in the pandemic, and thus, the pregnant women in these studies most likely did not have pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of infection.The susceptibility of pregnant women and their infants to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of infection may be attenuated as the pandemic progresses and an increasing number of women will have pre-existing immunity (following natural infection or vaccination prior to pregnancy) during pregnancy.The reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy may also be affected by the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women.Maternal vaccine trials should be evaluated in the context of their timing in the pandemic and interpreted based on the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women. Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines demonstrated high efficacy in clinical trials (1), they were not 100% efficacious.Thus, some infections postvaccination are expected.Limited data are available on effectiveness in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and against emerging variants.The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and a local health department investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in a SNF that occurred after all residents and health care personnel (HCP) had been offered vaccination.Among 83 residents and 116 HCP, 75 (90.4%) and 61 (52.6%), respectively, received 2 vaccine doses.Twenty-six residents and 20 HCP received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including 18 residents and four HCP who had received their second vaccine dose >14 days before the outbreak began.An R.1 lineage variant was detected with whole genome sequencing (WGS).Although the R.1 variant has multiple spike protein mutations, vaccinated residents and HCP were 87% less likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 compared with those who were unvaccinated.Vaccination of SNF populations, including HCP, is critical to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 introduction, transmission, and severe outcomes in SNFs.An ongoing focus on infection prevention and control practices is also essential. The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents us with a serious public health crisis.To combat the virus and slow its spread, wider testing is essential.There is a need for more sensitive, specific, and convenient detection methods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Advanced detection can greatly improve the ability and accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, which is conducive to the early suitable treatment and supports precise prophylaxis.In this article, we combine and present the latest laboratory diagnostic technologies and methods for SARS-CoV-2 to identify the technical characteristics, considerations, biosafety requirements, common problems with testing and interpretation of results, and coping strategies of commonly used testing methods.We highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity and propose potential solutions to provide cutting-edge technical support to achieve a more precise diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 and to overcome the difficulties with the normalization of epidemic prevention and control. The northern state of Amazonas is among the regions in Brazil most heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and has experienced two exponentially growing waves, in early and late 2020.Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020.The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months.Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus.These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide. Despite the growing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in the general population, a significant proportion of individuals demonstrate vaccine hesitancy.We sought to consolidate and update current evidence on cutaneous adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines to aid in the education and counseling of patients concerned about potential cutaneous side effects.We conducted a literature review of PubMed in May 2021 to identify reports of cutaneous events after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (postauthorization clinical reports pertaining to the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines were limited).Event reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System were reviewed.Localized cutaneous reactions were common after the mRNA vaccines, consistent with clinical trial findings.Reported urticarial and morbilliform eruptions may reflect immediate hypersensitivity but have rarely been associated with anaphylaxis.There are infrequent reports of herpes zoster, dermatologic filler reactions, and immune thrombocytopenia, mainly occurring in high-risk patient groups.Ultimately, the identified cutaneous reactions are largely self-limited and should not discourage vaccination.Existing reports should reassure patients of the overall compelling safety profiles of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and benignity of skin reactions after vaccination. Since the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 in December 2019, several lateral flow assay (LFA) devices were developed to enable the constant monitoring of regional and global infection processes.Additionally, innumerable lateral flow test devices are frequently used for determination of different clinical parameters, food safety, and environmental factors.Since common LFAs rely on non-biodegradable nitrocellulose membranes, we focused on their replacement by cellulose-composed, biodegradable papers.We report the development of cellulose paper-based lateral flow immunoassays using a carbohydrate-binding module-fused to detection antibodies.Studies regarding the protein binding capacity and potential protein wash-off effects on cellulose paper demonstrated a 2.7-fold protein binding capacity of CBM-fused antibody fragments compared to the sole antibody fragment.Furthermore, this strategy improved the spatial retention of CBM-fused detection antibodies to the test area, which resulted in an enhanced sensitivity and improved overall LFA-performance compared to the naked detection antibody.CBM-assisted antibodies were validated by implementation into two model lateral flow test devices (pregnancy detection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies).The CBM-assisted pregnancy LFA demonstrated sensitive detection of human gonadotropin (hCG) in synthetic urine and the CBM-assisted Covid-19 antibody LFA was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in serum.Our findings pave the way to the more frequent use of cellulose-based papers instead of nitrocellulose in LFA devices and thus potentially improve the sustainability in the field of POC diagnostics. Most COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit immune responses, ideally neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.Several vaccines, including mRNA, adenoviral-vectored, protein subunit and whole-cell inactivated virus vaccines, have now reported efficacy in phase III trials and have received emergency approval in many countries.The two mRNA vaccines approved to date show efficacy even after only one dose, when non-NAbs and moderate T helper 1 cell responses are detectable, but almost no NAbs.After a single dose, the adenovirus vaccines elicit polyfunctional antibodies that are capable of mediating virus neutralization and of driving other antibody-dependent effector functions, as well as potent T cell responses.These data suggest that protection may require low levels of NAbs and might involve other immune effector mechanisms including non-NAbs, T cells and innate immune mechanisms.Identifying the mechanisms of protection as well as correlates of protection is crucially important to inform further vaccine development and guide the use of licensed COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. WHO recommends a minimum of 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity for antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs), which can be used for patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19.However, after the acute phase when viral load decreases, use of Ag-RDTs might lead to high rates of false negatives, suggesting that the tests should be replaced by a combination of molecular and serological tests.When the likelihood of having COVID-19 is low, such as for asymptomatic individuals in low prevalence settings, for travel, return to schools, workplaces, and mass gatherings, Ag-RDTs with high negative predictive values can be used with confidence to rule out infection.For those who test positive in low prevalence settings, the high false positive rate means that mitigation strategies, such as molecular testing to confirm positive results, are needed.Ag-RDTs, when used appropriately, are promising tools for scaling up testing and ensuring that patient management and public health measures can be implemented without delay. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through airborne particles in exhaled breath, causing severe respiratory disease, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), in some patients.Samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing are typically collected by nasopharyngeal swab, with the virus detected by PCR; however, patients can test positive for 3 months after infection.Without the capacity to assay SARS-CoV-2 in breath, it is not possible to understand the risk for transmission from infected individuals.To detect virus in breath, the Bubbler-a breathalyzer that reverse-transcribes RNA from SARS-CoV-2 particles into a sample-specific barcoded cDNA-was developed.In a study of 70 hospitalized patients, the Bubbler was both more predictive of lower respiratory tract involvement (abnormal chest X-ray) and less invasive than alternatives.Samples tested using the Bubbler were threefold more enriched for SARS-CoV-2 RNA than were samples from tongue swabs, implying that virus particles were being directly sampled.The barcode-enabled Bubbler was used for simultaneous diagnosis in large batches of pooled samples at a lower limit of detection of 334 genomic copies per sample.Diagnosis by sequencing can provide additional information, such as viral load and strain identity.The Bubbler was configured to sample nucleic acids in water droplets circulating in air, demonstrating its potential in environmental monitoring and the protective effect of adequate ventilation. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the general community is still unclear.Here, we used the Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey-a large community-based survey of individuals living in randomly selected private households across the United Kingdom-to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca; ChAdOx1) vaccines against any new SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests, split according to self-reported symptoms, cycle threshold value (<30 versus 30; as a surrogate for viral load) and gene positivity pattern (compatible with B.1.1.7 or not).Using 1,945,071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections 21 d after the first dose (61% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 54-68%) versus 66% (95% CI = 60-71%), respectively), with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79% (95% CI = 65-88%) versus 80% (95% CI = 73-85%), respectively).The largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden.Overall, COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and with no evidence of a difference between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines. Vaccines developed in high-income countries have been enormously successful in reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, saving perhaps 2.5 million lives per year, but even for successful cases, like the rotavirus vaccine, global implementation may take a decade or more.For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest.A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few.With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60-80% of the worlds population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 1 million deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic and huge economic and social upheaval internationally.An efficacious vaccine is essential to prevent further morbidity and mortality.Although some countries might deploy COVID-19 vaccines on the strength of safety and immunogenicity data alone, the goal of vaccine development is to gain direct evidence of vaccine efficacy in protecting humans against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 so that manufacture of efficacious vaccines can be selectively upscaled.A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control.However, the most important efficacy endpoint, protection against severe disease and death, is difficult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials.In this Review, we explore the challenges in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, discuss the caveats needed to interpret reported efficacy endpoints, and provide insight into answering the seemingly simple question, "Does this COVID-19 vaccine work?" BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1.A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution.Case 2.A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance.The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion.The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone.However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution.CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest biological hazard for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Even though numerous diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed, new diagnosis strategies are being developed, looking for less expensive methods to be used as screening.This study aimed to establish salivary vibrational modes analyzed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to detect COVID-19 biological fingerprints that allow the discrimination between COVID-19 and healthy patients.Clinical dates, laboratories, and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients (N = 255) and healthy persons (N = 1209) were obtained and analyzed through ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.Then, a multivariate linear regression model (MLRM) was developed.The COVID-19 patients showed low SaO2, cough, dyspnea, headache, and fever principally.C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and ferritin were the most important altered laboratory blood tests, which were increased.In addition, changes in amide I and immunoglobulin regions were evidenced in the FTIR spectra analysis, and the MLRM showed clear discrimination between both groups.Specific salivary vibrational modes employing ATR-FTIR spectroscopy were established; moreover, the COVID-19 biological fingerprint in saliva was characterized, allowing the COVID-19 detection using an MLRM, which could be helpful for the development of new diagnostic devices. In January 2020, the coronavirus disease was declared, by the World Health Organization as a global public health emergency.Recommendations from the WHO COVID Emergency Committee continue to support strengthening COVID surveillance systems, including timely access to effective diagnostics.Questions were raised about the validity of considering the RT-PCR as the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnosis.It has been suggested that a variety of methods should be used to evaluate advocated tests.Dogs had been successfully trained and employed to detect diseases in humans.Here we show that upon training explosives detection dogs on sniffing COVID-19 odor in patients sweat, those dogs were able to successfully screen out 3249 individuals who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2, from a cohort of 3290 individuals.Additionally, using Bayesian analysis, the sensitivity of the K9 test was found to be superior to the RT-PCR test performed on nasal swabs from a cohort of 3134 persons.Given its high sensitivity, short turn-around-time, low cost, less invasiveness, and ease of application, the detection dogs test lends itself as a better alternative to the RT-PCR in screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals. BACKGROUND This study summarizes the characteristics of children screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and reports the case of 1 child who was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center and the cases of his family members.MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 159 children who were admitted to our hospital from January 23 to March 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed.Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test.RESULTS Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.A 7-year-old boy in a cluster family from Wuhan was confirmed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with ground-glass opacity shadows on his lung computed tomography scan, and his swab RT-PCR test had not turned negative until day 19 of his hospitalization.In patients who did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were observed.A total of 158 patients recovered, were discharged, and experienced no abnormalities during follow-up.CONCLUSIONS For SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infections, taking a "standard prevention & contact isolation & droplet isolation & air isolation" strategy can prevent infection effectively.Children with clustered disease need close monitoring. From 7 to 8 days after the onset of symptoms in COVID-19 infection, the sensitivity of serological tests was found to be higher than that of nucleic acid tests.The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits.A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study.Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits.No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples.In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days.The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%.While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation.The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high.In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test.Although ELISA tests are valuable in the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the acute period, they are tests that can be used safely in the diagnosis of previous infections and seroepidemiological studies. Coronaviruses are the paradigm of emerging 21st century zoonotic viruses, triggering numerous outbreaks and a severe global health crisis.The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 51 million people across the globe as of 12 November 2020.The crown-like spikes on the surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of viruses in the family Coronaviridae.The spike (S) protein adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the virus into the host.This multifunctional protein mediates the entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane.This review article focuses on the structural and functional comparison of S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Here, we review the current state of knowledge about receptor recognition, the membrane fusion mechanism, structural epitopes, and glycosylation sites of the S proteins of these viruses.We further discuss various vaccines and other therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and small molecules based on the S protein of these three viruses. As countries decide on vaccination strategies and how to ease movement restrictions, estimating the proportion of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 is important for predicting the future burden of COVID-19.This proportion is usually estimated from serosurvey data in two steps: first the proportion above a threshold antibody level is calculated, then the crude estimate is adjusted using external estimates of sensitivity and specificity.A drawback of this approach is that the PCR-confirmed cases used to estimate the sensitivity of the threshold may not be representative of cases in the wider population-e.g., they may be more recently infected and more severely symptomatic.Mixture modelling offers an alternative approach that does not require external data from PCR-confirmed cases.Here we illustrate the bias in the standard threshold-based approach by comparing both approaches using data from several Kenyan serosurveys.We show that the mixture model analysis produces estimates of previous infection that are often substantially higher than the standard threshold analysis. Low- and middle-income countries are implementing COVID-19 vaccination strategies in light of varying vaccine efficacies and costs, supply shortages, and resource constraints.Here, we use a microsimulation model to evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccination program in South Africa.We varied vaccination coverage, pace, acceptance, effectiveness, and cost as well as epidemic dynamics.Providing vaccines to at least 40% of the population and prioritizing vaccine rollout prevented >9 million infections and >73,000 deaths and reduced costs due to fewer hospitalizations.Model results were most sensitive to assumptions about epidemic growth and prevalence of prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2, though the vaccination program still provided high value and decreased both deaths and health care costs across a wide range of assumptions.Vaccination program implementation factors, including prompt procurement, distribution, and rollout, are likely more influential than characteristics of the vaccine itself in maximizing public health benefits and economic efficiency. Vaccination is essential to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.Vaccination significantly protects against severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death; it also protects against symptomatic infection and reduces the risk of transmission to other people.Protection against the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may be lower, but protection against severe course and death remains high.Two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and two vector vaccines (AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S) are currently available in the Czech Republic.Vaccination of persons over 60 years of age and immunocompromised persons, who are demonstrably at the highest risk of a serious course of the disease, is of the utmost importance.In order to achieve adequate vaccination coverage, it is necessary to motivate other groups of people to be vaccinated, including children over 12 years of age and young adults.Vaccination is also recommended in pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and in breastfeeding women.For selected groups of vaccines, a third dose of vaccination is recommended (additional third dose 4 weeks after the second dose or a booster dose 8 to 12 months after the second dose).The side effects are usually mild, with serious complications (including anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome, myocarditis, Guillain-Barr syndrome and capillary leak syndrome) being rare. Observational studies of the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are needed to inform real-world use.Such studies are now underway amid the ongoing rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines globally.Although traditional case-control and test-negative design studies feature prominently among strategies used to assess vaccine effectiveness, such studies may encounter important threats to validity.Here, we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs.Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, nonspecific indicators of COVID-19.When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes.The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection.The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance, if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness.These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources.We suggest practical strategies to reduce bias in vaccine effectiveness estimates at the study design and analysis stages. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 are more likely to require intensive care and die compared with noninfected pregnant women.While the consequences of COVID-19 disease in pregnancy prompted many health care organizations to support vaccination in pregnancy, vaccine effects for mother and infant remained unclear.In this issue of the JCI, Beharier and Mayo et al.explored maternal and neonatal responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.The authors examined blood samples from women and cord blood of neonates following childbirth.Samples were stratified into three groups: vaccine recipients, unvaccinated participants with past positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and unvaccinated participants without prior infection.Vaccinated mothers and mothers with previous infection generated and transferred protective IgG antibodies across the placenta.This study provides evidence to support the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy with protection to the neonate against infection, outlining clear vaccine benefits for both maternal and child health. In the fight against the recent COVID-19 pandemics, testing is crucial.Nasopharyngeal swabs and real-time RT-PCR are used for the detection of the viral RNA.The collection of saliva is non-invasive, pain-free and does not require trained personnel.An alternative to RT-PCR is loop-mediated isothermal amplification coupled with reverse transcription (RT-LAMP) that is easy to perform, quick and does not require a thermal cycler.The aim of this study was to test whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected directly in saliva using RT-LAMP.We have tested 16 primer mixes from the available literature in three rounds of sensitivity assays.The selected RT-LAMP primer mix has a limit of detection of 6 copies of viral RNA per reaction in comparison with RT-PCR with 1 copy per reaction.Whole saliva, as well as saliva collected using Salivette collection tubes, interfered with the RT-LAMP analysis.Neither Chelex-100 nor protease treatment of saliva prevented the inhibitory effect of saliva.With the addition of the ribonuclease inhibitor, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was 12 copies per reaction of RNA in Salivette saliva samples and 6 copies per reaction of RNA in whole saliva samples.This study shows that it is possible to combine the use of saliva and RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection without RNA extraction which was confirmed on a small set of correctly diagnosed clinical samples.Further studies should prove whether this protocol is suitable for point of care testing in the clinical setting. Efficient point-of-care diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corovavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for the early control of novel coronavirus infections.At present, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is primarily used to detect SARS-CoV-2.Despite the high sensitivity, the PCR process is time-consuming and complex which limits its applicability for rapid testing of large-scale outbreaks.Here, we propose a rapid and easy-to-implement approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy.The evaporated gold nano-island films are used as SEIRA substrates which are functionalized with the single-stranded DNA probes for specific binding to selected SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences.The infrared absorption spectra are analyzed using the principal component analysis method to identify the key characteristic differences between infected and control samples.The SEIRA-based biosensor demonstrates rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, completing the detection of 1 M viral nucleic acids within less than 5 min without any amplification.When combined with the recombinase polymerase amplification treatment, the detection capability of 2.98 copies per L (5 aM) can be completed within 30 min.This approach provides a simple and economical alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis, which can be potentially useful in monitoring and controlling future pandemics in a timely manner. There is a new public health problem around the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV).The disease "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) was caused by SARS-CoV-2.As virus isolates are unavailable so the public laboratories are now facing a challenge for detecting the virus because there is growing evidence of the outbreak which is more widespread than initially thought.We aimed here to discuss about the current diagnostic methodology for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 in health laboratories.Here we use the Novel Corona virus (2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit (PCR-Fluorescence Probing) which is a real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.A total of 230 samples in the department of microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College from 1st, April 2020 were selected for this study.Among them 20(8.69%) were positive for SARS CoV-2 and remaining were negative.Among the positive samples 55% could amplify both the ORF 1ab and N genes.The single gene ORF 1ab or N was positive in 15% and 30% cases respectively.The Ct values (<38) of ORF 1ab gene indicated by FAM dye was 92.8% and N gene curve indicated by ROX dye was 100%.The presence of IC gene curve with Ct values (<38) indicated by CY5 dye among the positives were 70% and 100% in negatives.The Ct values (38-40) of IC (CY5) among the positives were 15%.The present study demonstrates the enormous response capacity of the study kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 within the laboratories in Bangladesh. Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, different mitigation and management strategies limiting economic and social activities have been implemented across many countries.Despite these strategies, the virus continues to spread and mutate.As a result, vaccinations are now administered to suppress the pandemic.Current COVID-19 epidemic models need to be expanded to account for the change in behaviour of new strains, such as an increased virulence and higher transmission rate.Furthermore, models need to account for an increasingly vaccinated population.We present a network model of COVID-19 transmission accounting for different immunity and vaccination scenarios.We conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis and find the average immunity length after an infection to be one of the most critical parameters that define the spread of the disease.Furthermore, we simulate different vaccination strategies and show that vaccinating highly connected individuals first is the quickest strategy for controlling the disease. COVID-19 is the current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that emerged from China at the end of December 2019.The scientific community is making extraordinary efforts to understand the virus structure and the pathophysiology and immunological processes activated in the host, in order to identify biomarkers, diagnostic tools, treatments, and vaccines to decrease COVID-19 incidence and mortality.Various abnormalities have been noted during SARS-CoV-2 infection both in lymphoid and myeloid cells.Such abnormalities may disturb the immune system function and cause a massive inflammatory response that impairs tissue function.This review discusses the close relationship between the immune system abnormalities and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including fibrosis, in the context of COVID-19 disease.Moreover, we described the current strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis, and we provide a summary of the most useful clinical laboratory parameters to identify severe COVID-19 patients. Testing for COVID-19 is performed curatively for disease detection and as screening tool to prevent spread for public health and infection prevention.Testing for access is an important additional measure to provide information about asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection.In a recent meta-analysis 42.8% showed no symptoms with an estimated percentage of asymptomatic infections of 35.1%.False positive testing is not completely preventable but allows events such as the Eurovision Song Contest, professional football, the Olympic Games or Formula 1.Their trade-off is not purely medical but also political-economical.The choice to carry out many Dutch tests in foreign laboratories is inefficient, while at the same time the opportunity to strengthen regional innovation, training and infrastructure is missed.Cooperation between municipal health departments and regional laboratories and extra service from regional laboratories (such as fast variant PCR) are frustrated this way.We hope this situation will improve rapidly. The aim of this document is to provide a concise scientific review of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines and those in development, including mRNA, adenoviral vectors, and recombinant protein approaches.The anticipated use of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver transplant (LT) recipients is reviewed and practical guidance is provided for health care providers involved in the care of patients with liver disease and LT about vaccine prioritization and administration.The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a 94%-95% vaccine efficacy compared to placebo against COVID-19.Local site reactions of pain and tenderness were reported in 70%-90% of clinical trial participants, and systemic reactions of fever and fatigue were reported in 40%-70% of participants, but these reactions were generally mild and self-limited and occurred more frequently in younger persons.Severe hypersensitivity reactions related to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare and more commonly observed in women and persons with a history of previous drug reactions for unclear reasons.Because patients with advanced liver disease and immunosuppressed patients were excluded from the vaccine licensing trials, additional data regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are eagerly awaited in these and other subgroups.Remarkably safe and highly effective mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are now available for widespread use and should be given to all adult patients with CLD and LT recipients.The online companion document located at https://www.aasld.org/about-aasld/covid-19-resources will be updated as additional data become available regarding the safety and efficacy of other COVID-19 vaccines in development. The COVID-19 preparedness plans by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly underscores the need for efficient and effective testing strategies.This, in turn, calls upon the design and development of statistical sampling and testing of COVID-19 strategies.However, the evaluation of operational details requires a detailed representation of human behaviors in epidemic simulation models.Traditional epidemic simulations are mainly based upon system dynamic models, which use differential equations to study macro-level and aggregated behaviors of population subgroups.As such, individual behaviors (e.g., personal protection, commute conditions, social patterns) cant be adequately modeled and tracked for the evaluation of health policies and action strategies.Therefore, this paper presents a network-based simulation model to optimize COVID-19 testing strategies for effective identifications of virus carriers in a spatial area.Specifically, we design a data-driven risk scoring system for statistical sampling and testing of COVID-19.This system collects real-time data from simulated networked behaviors of individuals in the spatial network to support decision-making during the virus spread process.Experimental results showed that this framework has superior performance in optimizing COVID-19 testing decisions and effectively identifying virus carriers from the population. The humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a benchmark for immunity and detailed analysis is required to understand the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, monitor seroconversion within the general population, and support vaccine development.The majority of currently available commercial serological assays only quantify the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against individual antigens, limiting our understanding of the immune response.To overcome this, we have developed a multiplex immunoassay (MultiCoV-Ab) including spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses.Compared to three broadly used commercial in vitro diagnostic tests, our MultiCoV-Ab achieves a higher sensitivity and specificity when analyzing a well-characterized sample set of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals.We find a high response against endemic coronaviruses in our sample set, but no consistent cross-reactive IgG response patterns against SARS-CoV-2.Here we show a robust, high-content-enabled, antigen-saving multiplex assay suited to both monitoring vaccination studies and facilitating epidemiologic screenings for humoral immunity towards pandemic and endemic coronaviruses. Controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in Alaska is challenging.Alaska includes many remote and isolated villages with small populations (ranging from 15 to >1,000 persons) that are accessible only by air from larger communities.Until rapid point-of-care testing became widely available, a primary challenge in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in rural Alaska was slow turnaround times for SARS-CoV-2 test results, attributable to the need to transport specimens to testing facilities.To provide more timely test results and isolation of cases, the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) introduced Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test (BinaxNOW) on November 9, 2020, in the rural Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region in southwestern Alaska.To evaluate the impact of implementing antigen testing, YKHC reviewed the results of 54,981 antigen and molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta during September 15, 2020-March 1, 2021.Introduction of rapid, point-of-care testing was followed by a more than threefold reduction in daily SARS-CoV-2 case rates during approximately 1 month before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination.The median turnaround time for SARS-CoV-2 test results decreased by >30%, from 6.4 days during September 15-November 8, 2020, to 4.4 days during November 9, 2020-March 1, 2021 (p<0.001).Daily incidence decreased 65% after the introduction of BinaxNOW, from 342 cases per 100,000 population during the week of November 9 to 119 during the week of December 13 (p<0.001).These findings indicate that point-of-care rapid antigen testing can be a valuable tool in reducing turnaround times in rural communities where local access to laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is not readily available and could thereby reduce transmission by facilitating rapid isolation of infected persons, contact tracing, and implementation of local mitigation strategies. Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated.The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication.However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics.Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated.On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold.These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health threat.Most vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 target the highly glycosylated spike protein (S).A good knowledge of the glycosylation profile of this protein is key to successful vaccine development.Unlike the 22 confirmed N-glycosylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 S, only a few O-glycosylation sites on this protein have been reported.This difference is mainly ascribed to the extremely low stoichiometry of O-glycosylation.Herein, we designed the biomimetic materials, Trp-Arg (WR) monomer-grafted silica microspheres (designated as WR-SiO2), and these biomimetic materials can enrich N- and O-linked glycopeptides with high selectivity.And WR-SiO2 can resist the nonglycopeptides interference with the 100 molar fold of BSA during O-linked glycopeptide enrichment.We utilized WR-SiO2 to comprehensively analyze the O-glycosylation profile of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S. Twenty-seven O-glycosylation sites including 18 unambiguous sites are identified on SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study demonstrates that the biomimetic polymer can offer specific selectivity for O-linked glycopeptides and pave the way for O-glycosylation research in biological fields.The O-glycosylation profile of SARS-CoV-2 S might supplement the comprehensive glycosylation in addition to N-glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought attention and awareness to existing health disparities in underrepresented minority communities.Not only were minoritized populations disproportionately and negatively affected by COVID-19, but a history of mistrust and other systemic barriers prevented access to treatment and testing and even affected access and acceptance of the current vaccines.Pharmacists are essential to the provision of care for the general population, particularly during global crises.Minoritized pharmacists play an even greater role as partners with public health officials to translate science and build trust in minoritized community members who are hesitant about vaccine development, safety, and efficacy.Dedicated to representing the views and ideals of minority pharmacists on critical issues affecting health care, the National Pharmaceutical Association (NPhA) has been at the forefront of the pandemic.Throughout the pandemic, NPhA has prioritized the role of underrepresented practitioners, striving to improve awareness and access to underrepresented communities.While delivering education and information about the COVID-19 vaccine, clinical trials, population prioritization, and federal funding to our service areas and target populations, NPhA continues to challenge health care myths and address historical conflicts and systemic racism that often dictate the access to treatment and quality health care. Effective strategies are urgently needed to decrease the risk of untoward outcomes of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) infection.Pregnant women are a vulnerable population to infectious disease pandemics with dramatically increased infectious diseases-related serious complications, such as the need of hospitalizations, the need of admission to intensive care unit, and the final disease-related death compared with those nonpregnant counterparts or those pregnant women without infection.Several studies have shown that vaccinations in pregnancy are a safe and highly effective strategy, not only for pregnant women but also for fetus and/or newborn because of the passive transplacental transfer of antibodies to the offspring.Active and passive prevention of infectious diseases is approved as effective strategies for women who attempt to become pregnant or during pregnancy.Despite the large and proven scientific evidence, pregnant women still puzzle over whether they should get vaccinated.The question therefore arises: Why are pregnant women so reluctant to receive vaccination?The explanation is more likely in the way that the benefits of vaccination have been communicated "confusedly."In fact, like virtually all clinical trials, all the COVID-19 vaccine trials have excluded pregnant and lactating women from participating, contributing to uncertainty of safety and efficacy in COVID-19 vaccines that have been well prepared and available for the general adult population worldwide.Moreover, messenger RNA vaccine is a relatively brand-new vaccine, and experience with this type of vaccine is still scarce.It is hard to overcome this innovation deadlock.The knowledge and awareness of pregnant women who are at risk, and full information on the knowledge of vaccines and related preventable diseases in pregnant women may avoid hesitancy and increase vaccine acceptance.The current review is a part two addressing the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women.We focus on the up-to-date information about the application of vaccination on pregnant women, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans.Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans.SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans.This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019.Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid.Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis.Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals.The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development.Although the lungs are one of the target organs, the hypoxia mechanism is systemic and other organs begin to suffer both through lack of oxygen and through deregulation of inflammation control mechanisms. Adaptive immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics remain largely unknown.The neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are helpful for understanding the pathology.Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, serum sample neutralization values in symptomatic COVID-19 patients were measured using the chemiluminescence reduction neutralization test (CRNT).At least two sequential serum samples collected during hospitalization were analyzed to assess NAbs neutralizing activity dynamics at different time points.Of the 11 patients, four (36.4%), six (54.5%), and one (9.1%) had moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively.Fifty percent neutralization (N50%-CRNT) was observed upon admission in 90.9% (10/11); all patients acquired neutralizing activity 2-12 days after onset.In patients with moderate disease, neutralization was observed at earliest within two days after symptom onset.In patients with severe-to-critical disease, neutralization activity increased, plateauing 9-16 days after onset.Neutralization activity on admission was significantly higher in patients with moderate disease than in patients with severe-to-critical disease (relative % of infectivity, 6.4% vs. 41.1%; P = .011).Neutralization activity on admission inversely correlated with disease severity.The rapid NAb response may play a crucial role in preventing the progression of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a severe global health problem affecting almost every country in the world.Compared to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be more infectious thereby leading to a rapid spread of this disease across the world.The effective control of this disease relies on timely diagnosis, proper isolation, contact tracing of the infected people and segregation of vulnerable group from potential contamination.Currently, the gold standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS).However, NPS collection has several shortcomings.Besides requiring an active involvement of healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment (PPE), NPS collection is uncomfortable for the patient as it can induce coughing, gagging, vomiting and even bleeding.Evidence from current studies indicates that saliva has a potential to be useful as an alternative biological sample for COVID-19 diagnosis.Indeed, saliva as a biological sample offers several advantages over NPS.Saliva collection is better accepted by patients, it can be self-collected and does not require PPE and active involvement of healthcare personnel.Moreover, preliminary results indicate that the sensitivity and specificity of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis is similar to that of NPS.This summarizes recent observations in the field and discusses the potential use of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens.Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively.Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow.We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases.Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls.The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion.Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers.Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms.Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage.Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples.Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells.Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19.Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal.From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC.Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively.The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate.All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR.SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC.In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others.The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells.The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement.ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, spreading rapidly worldwide.Its high spread rate has turned it into public stigma.The current study is focusing on its treatment and control strategies on the basis of the facts and figs obtained from previous studies.Supplementation of infected person with minerals and vitamin would be very beneficial for faster recovery like in any other acute viral infection.Blood of a recovered person in any outbreak is very precious because it is containing high levels of neutralizing antibodies, memory T and B cells population.Both serum and buffy coat fractions of the blood will helpful for treatment as well as prophylaxis.The S proteins (spike) of SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV 1 have 70% similarity so the vaccine available for SARS would also be effective for COVID-19.Besides this, genome of SARS CoV 2 has been sequenced successfully and it is quite easy for the scientists to prepare DNA based vaccines and peptide-based subunit vaccines targeting the S protein of the virus.To control the spread of COVID-19, various disinfectant and antiseptics are very useful.The virus is also susceptible to heat, low pH and UV light so hot climatic conditions are also lethal to this virus. Since January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has been progressing at a rapid pace.To keep the pandemic at bay, countries have implemented various measures to interrupt the transmission of the virus from person to person and prevent an overload of their health systems.We analyze the impact of these measures implemented against the COVID-19 pandemic by using a sample of 68 countries, Puerto Rico and the 50 federal states of the United States of America, four federal states of Australia, and eight federal states of Canada, involving 6,941 daily observations.We show that measures are essential for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.After controlling for daily COVID-19 tests, we find evidence to suggest that school closures, shut-downs of non-essential business, mass gathering bans, travel restrictions in and out of risk areas, national border closures and/or complete entry bans, and nationwide curfews decrease the growth rate of the coronavirus and thus the peak of daily confirmed cases.We also find evidence to suggest that combinations of these measures decrease the daily growth rate at a level outweighing that of individual measures.Consequently, and despite extensive vaccinations, we contend that the implemented measures help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and ease the overstressed capacity of the healthcare systems. Despite the importance of nucleic acid testing in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, current detection approaches remain limited due to their high complexity and extensive processing.Here, we describe a molecular nanotechnology that enables direct and sensitive detection of viral RNA targets in native clinical samples.The technology, termed catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switch (CATCH), leverages DNA-enzyme hybrid complexes to form a molecular switch.By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity.CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/l), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay).When applied for clinical COVID-19 diagnostics, CATCH demonstrated direct and accurate detection in minimally processed patient swab samples. As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve, it has become evident that the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the virus may provide protection against future infection.Thus, as the creation and translation of effective COVID-19 vaccines continues at an unprecedented speed, the development of fast and effective methods to measure neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will become increasingly important to determine long-term protection against infection for both previously infected and immunized individuals.This paper describes a high-throughput protocol using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum from patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19.The use of a replicating pseudotyped virus eliminates the necessity for a containment level 3 facility required for SARS-CoV-2 handling, making this protocol accessible to virtually any containment level 2 lab.The use of a 96-well format allows for many samples to be run at the same time with a short turnaround time of 24 h. In French Polynesia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected on March 10th, 2020, in a resident returning from France.Between March 28th and July 14th, international air traffic was interrupted and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was brought under control, with only 62 cases recorded.The main challenge for reopening the air border without requiring travelers to quarantine on arrival was to limit the risk of re-introducing SARS-CoV-2.Specific measures were implemented, including the obligation for all travelers to have a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 carried out within 3 days before departure, and to perform another RT-PCR testing 4 days after arrival.Because of limitation in available medical staff, travelers were provided a kit allowing self-collection of oral and nasal swabs.In addition to increase our testing capacity, self-collected samples from up to 10 travelers were pooled before RNA extraction and RT-PCR testing.When a pool tested positive, RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed on each individual sample.We report here the results of COVID-19 surveillance (COV-CHECK PORINETIA) conducted between July 15th, 2020, and February 15th, 2021, in travelers using self-collection and pooling approaches.We tested 5,982 pools comprising 59,490 individual samples, and detected 273 (0.46%) travelers positive for SARS-CoV-2.A mean difference of 1.17 Ct (CI 95% 0.93-1.41) was found between positive individual samples and pools (N = 50), probably related to the volume of samples used for RNA extraction (200 L versus 50 L, respectively).Retrospective testing of positive samples self-collected from October 20th, 2020, using variants-specific amplification kit and spike gene sequencing, found at least 6 residents infected by the Alpha variant.Self-collection and pooling approaches allowed large-scale screening for SARS-CoV-2 using less human, material and financial resources.Moreover, this strategy allowed detecting the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in French Polynesia. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses grave threats to both the global economy and health.The predominant diagnostic screens in use for SARS-CoV-2 detection are molecular techniques such as nucleic acid amplification tests.In this Review, we compare current and emerging isothermal diagnostic methods for COVID-19.We outline the molecular and serological techniques currently being used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, past or present, in patients.We also discuss ongoing research on isothermal techniques, CRISPR-mediated detection assays, and point-of-care diagnostics that have potential for use in SARS-CoV-2 detection.Large-scale viral testing during a global pandemic presents unique challenges, chief among them the simultaneous need for testing supplies, durable equipment, and personnel in many regions worldwide, with each of these regions possessing testing needs that vary as the pandemic progresses.The low-cost isothermal technologies described in this Review provide a promising means by which to address these needs and meet the global need for testing of symptomatic individuals as well as provide a possible means for routine testing of asymptomatic individuals, providing a potential means of safely enabling reopenings and early monitoring of outbreaks. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a major burden worldwide, resulting in serious public health challenges.HBV infection is another widely spread virus that chronically affects about 257 million people.The management of patients with HBV infection has gained attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Patients with COVID-19 have varying levels of liver involvements, resulting from direct viral effects on the liver as well as hepatotoxic drugs.This was demonstrated by elevated levels of liver enzymes, particularly evident in those patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.However, scarce information is available on the management of COVID-19 patients having an underlying chronic liver disease, including HBV infection.Studies have shown reactivation of HBV infection following treatment with tocilizumab and corticosteroids, emphasizing the need for caution when using these agents to treat COVID-19 patients with HBV infection.HBV screening and prophylaxis should be considered in patients with elevated transaminase levels and also in high prevalence populations.In patients with advanced liver disease, attention must be given to minimize the risk of liver decompensation.Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to enable an evidence-based approach for the care of these patients. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally.To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection.Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways.Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections.Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced.In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections.Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections.During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful.Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients.However, the benefits of probiotics are strain-specific, and it is necessary to identify the bacterial strains that are scientifically established to be beneficial. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed difficulties in scaling current quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based diagnostic methodologies for large-scale infectious disease testing.Bottlenecks include lengthy multi-step processes for nucleic acid extraction followed by qPCR readouts, which require costly instrumentation and infrastructure, as well as reagent and plastic consumable shortages stemming from supply chain constraints.Here we report an Oil Immersed Lossless Total Analysis System (OIL-TAS), which integrates RNA extraction and detection onto a single device that is simple, rapid, cost effective, and requires minimal supplies and infrastructure to perform.We validated the performance of OIL-TAS using contrived SARS-CoV-2 viral particle samples and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples.OIL-TAS showed a 93% positive predictive agreement (n = 57) and 100% negative predictive agreement (n = 10) with clinical SARS-CoV-2 qPCR assays in testing clinical samples, highlighting its potential to be a faster, cheaper, and easier-to-deploy alternative for infectious disease testing. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase, and lots of countries are facing tremendous pressure on both public and medical resources.Although RT-PCR is the most widely used detection technology with COVID-19 detection, it still has some limitations, such as high cost, being time-consuming, and having low sensitivity.According to the characteristics of chest X-ray (CXR) images, we design the Parallel Channel Attention Feature Fusion Module (PCAF), as well as a new structure of convolutional neural network MCFF-Net proposed based on PCAF.In order to improve the recognition efficiency, the network adopts 3 classifiers: 1-FC, GAP-FC, and Conv1-GAP.The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of MCFF-Net66-Conv1-GAP model is 94.66% for 4-class classification.Simultaneously, the classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of COVID-19 are 100%.MCFF-Net may not only assist clinicians in making appropriate decisions for COVID-19 diagnosis but also mitigate the lack of testing kits. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need for a rapid, point of care diagnostic testing that could be rapidly scaled on a worldwide level.We developed and tested a highly sensitive and robust assay based on reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) that uses readily available reagents and a simple heat block using contrived spike-in and actual clinical samples.RT-LAMP testing on RNA-spiked samples showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.5 copies/l of viral transport media.RT-LAMP testing directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media had an 85% positive percentage agreement (PPA) (17/20), and 100% negative percentage agreement (NPV) and delivered results in 30 min.Our optimized RT-LAMP based testing method is a scalable system that is sufficiently sensitive and robust to test for SARS-CoV-2 directly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples in viral transport media in 30 min at the point of care without the need for specialized or proprietary equipment or reagents.This cost-effective and efficient one-step testing method can be readily available for COVID-19 testing world-wide, especially in resource poor settings. Mobilizing the research ecosystem for accelerating vaccine and drug development has been an important reality of the pandemic.This article reviews the scientific advances that are attained by the COVID-19 Turkey Platform for vaccine and drug development against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The platform that is coordinated by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey is established with a "co-creation and succeeding together" approach, which involves 436 researchers across 49 different institutions working on 17 vaccine and drug development projects in total.Recent advances of the COVID-19 Turkey Platform include the fourth virus-like particle-based vaccine candidate in the world to enter clinical studies based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 vaccine tracker that is currently completing phase 2 clinical studies on the path towards initiating phase 3 clinical studies.Moreover, an adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate and two drug candidates that have been identified through the virtual scanning of more than 20,000 molecules are currently in clinical studies.Other vaccines and drug candidates involve additional innovative aspects, and a locally synthesized drug is found to have an impact on COVID-19.This review article discusses the advances that are achieved by the COVID-19 Turkey Platform from the ecosystem perspective, emphasizing the important scientific advances that have been achieved in the field of medical sciences. Between August and September 2021, the European Court of Human Rights rejected three requests for interim measures against France and Greeces compulsory vaccination statutes against COVID-19.Due to the procedural nature of the interim measures, however, the status of vaccine mandates against SARS-CoV-2 under the European Convention of Human Rights has not been addressed.The paper argues that COVID-19 compulsory vaccination is consistent with both the text and the original understanding of Article 8 of the Convention.Moreover, considering pertinent case law on medical mandatory treatments, COVID-19 vaccine mandates should also square with the European Court of Human Rights "living instrument" doctrine.For this reason, it is expected that the European Court of Human rights will uphold COVID-19 vaccination programs.At the same time, it would be beneficial if more Council of Europe member states triggered Article 15 derogation mechanism in order to make an even stronger case for fast-track developed vaccines and contrast vaccine hesitancy. A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities that are sufficient to immunize large populations.Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles.BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon).BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane S glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)).The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity.Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD down, one-RBD up state.In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFN+CD8+ T cell responses.Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2 that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera.The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement.Both candidates are being evaluated in phase I trials in Germany and the USA1-3, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phase II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728). Even with the advent of the COVID-19 vaccine, masks and social distancing are recommended as a precautionary measure to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.In Israel, as in many other countries, despite official regulations and widespread availability and accessibility to affordable effective masks, the use of face masks is not consistent or universal.Physicians and other medical and health professionals have a vital role to play in communicating to the public about the importance of masking and encouraging people to wear face masks correctly and consistently.This review underscores the importance of masking as a protective public health mitigation measure.It describes types of face masks mainly used by the public and their effectiveness.It emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing barriers (e.g., physical, social, economic) to encourage widespread and sustained appropriate use of masks.The article also proposes strategies to enhance masking, such as changing social norms through targeted local interventions and governmental control of mask quality and price. Immunization against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Israel began on December 2020, using the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.Individuals aged 60 years or older and medical staff were prioritized in COVID-19 immunization, and currently individuals aged 16 years or older are eligible to receive the vaccine.To achieve levels of community immunity (herd immunity) immunization of 60-70% of the population is required.As of mid-February 2021, about 42% of the population in Israel received the first vaccine dose, and the coverage exceeded 70% in individuals aged 50 years or older.Despite this success, the rates of COVID-19 immunization are lower in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations compared to the general Jewish population.We reviewed factors that might affect acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.Factors that might influence the individuals willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 include concerns about the safety of the vaccine, recommendations by employers and treating physicians.Moreover, differences were found in the willingness to be vaccinated according to socio-demographic characteristics, such as employment, age and gender groups, and even political affiliation.Minority populations are vulnerable to misinformation about vaccines.The Arab and the ultraorthodox populations are the main minority groups in Israel, and characterized by lifestyle, and low socio-economic status, which increased, among other factors, the incidence of COVID-19 in these populations.To improve vaccine uptake in the ultraorthodox and Arab populations, there is an urgent need for better tailored solutions to the unique needs of these minority populations, which comprise main risk groups for misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines.Moreover, a better understanding of the reasons for low uptake of COVID-19 vaccine in these populations is warranted.These activities should be undertaken in parallel to continuous efforts towards reducing socio-economic disparities between sub-population groups. Several countries with advanced adult COVID-19 immunisation programmes have already started vaccinating adolescents with an mRNA vaccine that recently received emergency use authorisation for 12-15 year-olds.The decision to vaccinate adolescents remains highly divisive among parents, clinicians, politicians and policy makers.There are very few downsides to immunising adolescents with a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine because that would significantly reduce their risk of COVID-19 and all its complications.Based on current evidence, however, adolescents have a very low risk of severe or fatal COVID-19, even among those with comorbidities, or rare complications such as long COVID or Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS-TS), a hyperinflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2.Additionally, currently authorised vaccines are very reactogenic and have limited post-marketing population-level safety data in adolescents and young adults, but these are emerging from countries that have forged ahead with vaccinating adolescents.Countries that have yet to make a recommendation can afford to wait until there is sufficient information to make informed decisions on the risk-benefits of vaccinating adolescents with current and future COVID-19 vaccines.Alternatives to two-dose vaccination in adolescents may include a single dose or a reduced dose schedule as is currently being trialled in younger children. Phylogenetic and pathogenesis studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) strains have highlighted some specific mutations that could confer the RNA genome fitness advantages and immunological resistance for their rapid spread in the human population.The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection.The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains.Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release.Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication.However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects.Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients.During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells.We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution.Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge. Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, molecular diagnostic testing for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has faced substantial supply chain shortages and noteworthy delays in result reporting after sample collection.Supply chain shortages have been most evident in reagents for RNA extraction and rapid diagnostic testing.This study explored the kinetic limitations of extraction-free rapid cycle quantitative real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection using the commercially available capillary-based LightCycler.After optimizing for time and reaction conditions, a protocol for sensitive and specific quantitative RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs in <20 minutes was developed, with minimal hands-on time requirements.This protocol improves detection speed while maintaining the sensitivity and specificity of hydrolysis probe-based detection.Percentage agreement between the developed assay and previously tested positive patient samples was 97.6% (n = 40/41), and negative patient samples was 100% (40/40).The study further demonstrates that using purified RNA, SARS-CoV-2 testing using extreme RT-PCR, and product verification by melting can be completed in <3 minutes.Overall, these studies provide a framework for increasing the speed of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious disease testing. Tests for COVID-19 generally measure SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from nasal swabs or antibodies against the virus from blood.It has been shown, however, that both viral particles and antibodies against those particles are present in saliva, which is more accessible than both swabs and blood.We present methods for highly sensitive measurements of both viral RNA and antibodies from the same saliva sample.We developed an efficient saliva RNA extraction method and combined it with an ultrasensitive antibody test based on single molecule array (Simoa) technology.We apply our test to the saliva of patients who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, some of whom tested positive with a conventional RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal swab test.We demonstrate that combining viral RNA detection by RT-qPCR with antibody detection by Simoa identifies more patients as infected than either method alone.Our results demonstrate the utility of combining viral RNA and antibody testing from saliva, a single easily accessible biofluid. The development and deployment of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in a little over a year is an unprecedented achievement of modern medicine.The high levels of efficacy against transmission for some of these vaccines makes it feasible to use them to suppress SARS-CoV-2 altogether in regions with high vaccine acceptance.However, viral variants with reduced susceptibility to vaccinal and natural immunity threaten the utility of vaccines, particularly in scenarios where a return to pre-pandemic conditions occurs before the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.In this work we model the situation in the United States in May-June 2021, to demonstrate how pre-existing variants of SARS-CoV-2 may cause a rebound wave of COVID-19 in a matter of months under a certain set of conditions.A high burden of morbidity (and likely mortality) remains possible, even if the vaccines are partially effective against new variants and widely accepted.Our modeling suggests that variants that are already present within the population may be capable of quickly defeating the vaccines as a public health intervention, a serious potential limitation for strategies that emphasize rapid reopening before achieving control of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19, caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection.The disease has now reached the level of a global pandemic and as a result a more rapid and simple detection method is imperative to curb the spread of the virus.We aimed to develop a visual diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 based on colorimetric RT-LAMP with levels of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of commercial qRT-PCR assays.In this work, the primers were designed to target a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp).The assay was characterized for its sensitivity and specificity, and validated with clinical specimens collected in Thailand.The developed colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could amplify the target gene and enabled visual interpretation in 60 min at 65 C. No cross-reactivity with six other common human respiratory viruses (influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human metapneumovirus) and five other human coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, 229E and NL63) was observed.The limit of detection was 25 copies per reaction when evaluated with contrived specimens.However, the detection rate at this concentration fell to 95.8% when the incubation time was reduced from 60 to 30 min.The diagnostic performance of the developed RT-LAMP assay was evaluated in 2120 clinical specimens and compared with the commercial qRT-PCR.The results revealed high sensitivity and specificity of 95.74% and 99.95%, respectively.The overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was determined to be 99.86%.In summary, our results indicate that the developed colorimetric RT-LAMP provides a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, implying its beneficial use as a diagnostic platform for COVID-19 screening. Simple tests of infectiousness that return results in minutes and directly from samples even with low viral loads could be a potential game-changer in the fight against COVID-19.Here, we describe an improved isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay, termed the RICCA (RNA Isothermal Co-assisted and Coupled Amplification) reaction, that consists of a simple one-pot format of sample-in and result-out with a primary focus on the detection of low copy numbers of RNA virus directly from saliva without the need for laboratory processing.We demonstrate our assay by detecting 16S rRNA directly from E. coli cells with a sensitivity as low as 8 CFU/L and RNA fragments from a synthetic template of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity as low as 1740 copies/L.We further demonstrate the applicability of our assay for real-time testing at the point of care by designing a closed format for paper-based lateral flow assay and detecting heat-inactivated SARS-COV-2 virus in human saliva at concentrations ranging from 28,000 to 2.8 copies/L with a total assay time of 15-30 min. Developing and distributing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine has garnered immense global interest.Less than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several vaccine candidates had received emergency use authorization across a range of countries.Despite this scientific breakthrough, the journey from vaccine discovery to global herd immunity against COVID-19 continues to present significant policy challenges that require a collaborative, global response.We offer a framework for understanding remaining and new policy challenges for successful global vaccine campaigns against COVID-19 as well as potential solutions to address them.Decision-makers must be aware of these challenges and strategize solutions that can be implemented at scale.These include challenges around maintaining R&D incentives, running clinical trials, authorizations, post-market surveillance, manufacturing and supply, global dissemination, allocation, uptake, and clinical system adaption.Alongside these challenges, financial and ethical concerns must also be addressed. The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world.Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease.In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred).By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence.We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus.The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine.The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools.Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency.In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies.Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus. The increasing number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide poses challenges to healthcare systems not only in effectively identifying individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, but also in isolating cases to minimise contagion in early diagnosing more severe cases that will need hospitalization.Less-invasive collection methods are indispensable in a pandemic scenario as large-scale tests are necessary to understand the actual evolution of contagion in different populations, thus enabling decision-making based on scientific evidence.Saliva has been shown to be an alternative for diagnosing viral infections as this biological fluid can be easily and quickly collected without using specific devices and causing less discomfort during collection, which is an important factor for use in children.Despite the smaller percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 among children, they seem to play an important role in the contagion as they have the same potential of transmission as that of adults.Knowing the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in children is extremely important, mainly regarding the changing in rules of social distancing, such as re-opening schools and recreational activities spaces.In addition, countless cases of a severe multi-systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares clinical and laboratory features with Kawasakis disease have been recently related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, adolescents and young adults.In view of this scenario, the aim of this study was to present saliva as an alternative for seeking diagnostic and prognostic markers of COVID-19 in children, including adequate sample collection techniques for different age groups. The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has brought an unprecedented impact upon the global economy and public health.Although the SARS-CoV-2 virology has been gradually investigated, measures to combat this new threat in public health are still absent.To date, no certificated drug or vaccine has been developed for the treatment or prevention of coronavirus disease Extensive researches and international coordination has been conducted to rapidly develop novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Several major breakthroughs have been made through the identification of the genetic sequence and structural/non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which enabled the development of RNA-, DNA-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and attenuated viral vaccines.In this review article, we present an overview of the recent advances of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the challenges that may be encountered in the development process, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches that may help in effectively countering COVID-19. Patients with strong clinical features of COVID-19 with negative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 testing are not currently included in official statistics.The scale, characteristics and clinical relevance of this group are not well described.We performed a retrospective cohort study in two large London hospitals to characterize the demographic, clinical, and hospitalization outcome characteristics of swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients.We found 1 in 5 patients with a negative swab and clinical suspicion of COVID-19 received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 within clinical documentation, discharge summary or death certificate.We compared this group to a similar swab positive cohort and found similar demographic composition, symptomology and laboratory findings.Swab-negative clinical COVID-19 patients had better outcomes, with shorter length of hospital stay, reduced need for > 60% supplementary oxygen and reduced mortality.Patients with strong clinical features of COVID-19 that are swab-negative are a common clinical challenge.Health systems must recognize and plan for the management of swab-negative patients in their COVID-19 clinical management, infection control policies and epidemiological assessments. Early diagnosis of the harmful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), along with clinical expertise, allows governments to break the transition chain and flatten the epidemic curve.Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers quick results, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a more reliable method for disease classification and assessment.The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered extensive research towards developing a COVID-19 detection toolkit.Recent studies have confirmed that the deep learning-based approach, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provides an optimized solution for COVID-19 classification; however, they require substantial training data for learning features.Gathering this training data in a short period has been challenging during the pandemic.Therefore, this study proposes a new model of CNN and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) that classify CXR images into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19.The proposed model contains eight convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers, which provide better results than the existing pretrained methods (AlexNet and GoogLeNet).DCGAN performs two tasks: (1) generating synthetic/fake images to overcome the challenges of an imbalanced dataset and (2) extracting deep features of all images in the dataset.In addition, it enlarges the dataset and represents the characteristics of diversity to provide a good generalization effect.In the experimental analysis, we used four distinct publicly accessible datasets of chest X-ray images (COVID-19 X-ray, COVID Chest X-ray, COVID-19 Radiography, and CoronaHack-Chest X-Ray) to train and test the proposed CNN and the existing pretrained methods.Thereafter, the proposed CNN method was trained with the four datasets based on the DCGAN synthetic images, resulting in higher accuracy (94.8%, 96.6%, 98.5%, and 98.6%) than the existing pretrained models.The overall results suggest that the proposed DCGAN-CNN approach is a promising solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. BACKGROUND At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a cluster outbreak caused by an imported case from Hubei Province was reported in Xian City, Shaanxi Province, China.Ten patients from 2 families and 1 hospital were involved in the transmission.MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation to identify the cluster transmission of COVID-19.The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed.RESULTS From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital.Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic.The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1-5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16-38 days), respectively.There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively.Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission.CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission.The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms.Meanwhile, people in high-risk areas should improve their protective measures. Shortages of reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents and related equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the need for alternative, high-throughput methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mass screening in clinical diagnostic laboratories.A robust, SARS-CoV-2 RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay with high-throughput and short turnaround times in a clinical laboratory setting was established and compared to two conventional RT-PCR protocols using 323 samples of individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.Limit of detection (LoD) and reproducibility of the isolation-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test were determined.An almost perfect agreement (Cohens kappa > 0.8) between the novel test and two classical RT-PCR protocols with no systematic difference (McNemars test, P > 0.05) was observed.Sensitivity and specificity were in the range of 89.5 to 100% and 96.2 to 100% dependent on the reaction condition and the RT-PCR method used as reference.The isolation-free RT-LAMP assay showed high reproducibility (Tt intra-run coefficient of variation [CV] = 0.4%, Tt inter-run CV = 2.1%) with a LoD of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction.The established SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a flexible and efficient alternative to conventional RT-PCR protocols, suitable for SARS-CoV-2 mass screening using existing laboratory infrastructure in clinical diagnostic laboratories. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promotes the "Leaving no one behind" principle and sets goals in areas of critical importance.This principle has become extraordinarily important during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is especially relevant for fragile populations, such as people experiencing homelessness.Homeless persons live in congregate and poor hygiene settings that may favor virus transmission, often have underling physical and mental comorbidities that place them at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19, and have limited access to public healthcare and social services.In addition, the homeless are often overlooked by safety and health monitoring actions.All of these factors, taken together, place homeless persons at high risk of being left behind.It is therefore of utmost importance to put in place adequate public health measures to limit spread of infection among homeless persons, rapidly identify and isolate asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic subjects, promptly and appropriately treat positive cases, and correctly handle the entire socioeconomic environment of vulnerable people. Introduction There is an urgent need to check the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialyzed (HD) patients known to have extensive disturbances of acquired immunity and a catastrophic risk of death from COVID-19.Objectives In a cross-sectional study we aimed to assess the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 (BioNTech / Pfizer Comirnaty) vaccine.Patients and methods We analyzed the titer magnitude of the IgG antibodies directed against spike (S)- SARS-CoV-2 antigen 14-21 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of HD patients who have not been confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection yet, compared to patients with a history of COVID-19.126 HD patients were stratified based on evidence of a previous infection with SARS-COV-2 confirmed with viral RNA detection or nucleocapsid-specific IgG antibodies detection.Results s-antigen immune response with a median (IQR) antibody titer of 366 (193-691) UA/ml was seen in 87 of 91 infection nave (IN)-HD patients (95.6%).In 68 of 91 IN-HD patients (74.7%) a strong humoral response was observed with titer anti-S antibodies above 200 UA/ml.Older subjects were less likely to develop an S-antibodies response (P <0.001).The median S-antigen antibody titer in 35 previously infected (PI)-HD patients was over 12-fold higher than in IN-HD patients; 4620 (1240-7820) UA/ml (P <0.001).There were no significant differences in S-antibody titer between symptomatic and asymptomatic PI-HD patients.Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the majority of HD patients achieved a high immunization rate after vaccination with BNT162b2.Whether this translates into protecting this population from COVID-19 requires further research. Coronavirus disease is caused by a virus that is the cause of a potentially fatal disease worldwide.Coronavirus is a pathogen that primarily affects the human respiratory system.Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been named WHO since February 11, 2020.The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019.In January 2020, COVID-19 infection was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China.We analyze the role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in viral infection with special emphasize on novel corona virus disease-COVID-19.NLR may be used for early detection and may reflect progression to the more severe illness leading to SARS-CoV-2.In the mini review we investigate the use of NLR as a surrogate marker for diagnosis and stratification of COVID-19.Clinical symptoms such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart damage have led to death.In some cases, multiple inflammations have been observed.Treatment with interferon inhalation showed no clinical effect and the condition worsened instead (Tab.5, Fig.1, Ref.18).Keywords: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, corona virus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19. COVID-19 has tremendously impacted patients and medical systems globally.Computed tomography images can effectively complement the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing.This study adopted a convolutional neural network for COVID-19 testing.We examined the performance of different pre-trained models on CT testing and identified that larger, out-of-field datasets boost the testing power of the models.This suggests that a priori knowledge of the models from out-of-field training is also applicable to CT images.The proposed transfer learning approach proves to be more successful than the current approaches described in literature.We believe that our approach has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in identification thus far.Based on experiments with randomly sampled training datasets, the results reveal a satisfactory performance by our model.We investigated the relevant visual characteristics of the CT images used by the model; these may assist clinical doctors in manual screening. The global supply of COVID-19 vaccines remains limited.An understanding of the immune response that is predictive of protection could facilitate rapid licensure of new vaccines.Data from a randomized efficacy trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the United Kingdom was analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2.Binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and noninfected vaccine recipients.Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection.A vaccine efficacy of 80% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 264 (95% CI: 108, 806) binding antibody units (BAU)/ml: and 506 (95% CI: 135, not computed (beyond data range) (NC)) BAU/ml for anti-spike and anti-RBD antibodies, and 26 (95% CI: NC, NC) international unit (IU)/ml and 247 (95% CI: 101, NC) normalized neutralization titers (NF50) for pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization, respectively.Immune markers were not correlated with asymptomatic infections at the 5% significance level.These data can be used to bridge to new populations using validated assays, and allow extrapolation of efficacy estimates to new COVID-19 vaccines. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host cells, and neutralizing antibodies are effective at blocking this interaction to prevent infection.Widespread application of this important marker of protective immunity is limited by logistical and technical challenges associated with live virus methods and venous blood collection.To address this gap, we validated an immunoassay-based method for quantifying neutralization of the spike-ACE2 interaction in a single drop of capillary whole blood, collected on filter paper as a dried blood spot (DBS) sample.Samples are eluted overnight and incubated in the presence of spike antigen and ACE2 in a 96-well solid phase plate.Competitive immunoassay with electrochemiluminescent label is used to quantify neutralizing activity.The following measures of assay performance were evaluated: dilution series of confirmed positive and negative samples, agreement with results from matched DBS-serum samples, analysis of results from DBS samples with known COVID-19 status, and precision (intra-assay percent coefficient of variation; %CV) and reliability (inter-assay; %CV).Dilution series produced the expected pattern of dose-response.Agreement between results from serum and DBS samples was high, with concordance correlation = 0.991.Analysis of three control samples across the measurement range indicated acceptable levels of precision and reliability.Median % surrogate neutralization was 46.9 for PCR confirmed convalescent COVID-19 samples and 0.1 for negative samples.Large-scale testing is important for quantifying neutralizing antibodies that can provide protection against COVID-19 in order to estimate the level of immunity in the general population.DBS provides a minimally-invasive, low cost alternative to venous blood collection, and this scalable immunoassay-based method for quantifying inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction can be used as a surrogate for virus-based assays to expand testing across a wide range of settings and populations. The development of new methods for direct viral detection using streamlined and ideally reagent-free assays is a timely and important, but challenging, problem.The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand.Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting.Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip.The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe.When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface.Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor.This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody.We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva. Serological testing is essential to curb the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.However, most assays are still limited to single analytes and samples collected within healthcare.Thus, we establish a multianalyte and multiplexed approach to reliably profile IgG and IgM levels against several versions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, RBD, N) in home-sampled dried blood spots (DBS).We analyse DBS collected during spring of 2020 from 878 random and undiagnosed individuals from the population in Stockholm, Sweden, and use classification approaches to estimate an accumulated seroprevalence of 12.5% (95% CI: 10.3%-14.7%).This includes 5.4% of the samples being IgG+IgM+ against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as 2.1% being IgG-IgM+ and 5.0% being IgG+IgM- for the virus S protein.Subjects classified as IgG+ for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins report influenza-like symptoms more frequently than those being IgG+ for only the S protein (OR = 6.1; p < 0.001).Among all seropositive cases, 30% are asymptomatic.Our strategy enables an accurate individual-level and multiplexed assessment of antibodies in home-sampled blood, assisting our understanding about the undiagnosed seroprevalence and diversity of the immune response against the coronavirus. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the third known animal coronavirus, after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).The mean age of the infected patients was estimated to be between 50 and 69 years old.Accordingly, the COVID-19 mortality rate was calculated as 15%.In this regard, the essential component of prevention and planning is knowledge of laboratory and demographic findings among COVID-19 patients; therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate laboratory and demographic findings among these patients worldwide.This systematic review was performed on the articles published in English between January 1, 2019 and May 4, 2020, using MeSH-compliant keywords such as "COVID-19", "Laboratory, coronavirus disease-19 testing", and " demography " in international databases (PubMed, and web of science Scopus).Thereafter, the articles relevant to laboratory and demographic findings among COVID-19 patients were included in the final review.Reviewing the included articles showed changes in the mean lymphocytes count ranged from 0.7 to 39 in hospital or severe cases.Moreover, Leukopenia was not observed in patients with thrombocytopenia.In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, D-dimer, FDP, FIB, neutrophils, AST, serum creatinine, t-troponin, troponin I, and blood bilirubin levels showed increasing trends in most studies conducted on COVID-19 patients.Notably, the elevated LDH level was more common among children than adults.According to the results of the present study, and by considering the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients on the one hand, and considering the changes in laboratory samples such as lymphocytes and other blood markers due to the damaged myocardial, hepatic, and renal tissues on the other hand, it is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of this infection by evaluating the patients blood samples using other diagnostic methods like lung scan. Multiple tissue samples were obtained during emergent abdominal surgery in 4 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to examine for tissue involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The first patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder empyema and died from severe respiratory failure.The second patient with Crohn disease underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforation in the terminal ileum and recovered.The third patient underwent an open appendectomy and recovered.The fourth patient underwent emergent laparotomy for a perforated peptic ulcer and died from sepsis.Although the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the feces of 3 patients and in the duodenal wall of the patient with perforated peptic ulcer, real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination of abdominal fluid was negative for the virus.The RT-PCR did not detect viral RNA in the wall of small intestine, appendix, gallbladder, bile, liver, and urine.Visceral fat (omentum) and abdominal subcutaneous fat of 4 patients were also not infected with the SARS-CoV-2.Although this limited experience did not show direct involvement of abdominal fluid and omentum, assessment in large series is suggested to provide answers about the safety of abdominal surgery in patients with COVID-19. Unquestionably, polymers have influenced the world over the past 100 years.They are now more crucial than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.The pandemic paved the way for certain polymers to be in the spotlight, namely sequence-defined polymers such as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which was the first type of vaccine to be authorized in the U.S. and Europe to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.This rise of mRNA will probably influence scientific research concerning nucleic acids in general and RNA therapeutics in specific.In this Perspective, we highlight the recent trends in sequence-controlled and sequence-defined polymers.Then we discuss mRNA vaccines as an example to illustrate the need of ultimate sequence control to achieve complex functions such as specific activation of the immune system.We briefly present how mRNA vaccines are produced, the importance of modified nucleotides, the characteristic features, and the advantages and challenges associated with this class of vaccines.Finally, we discuss the chances and opportunities for polymer chemistry to provide solutions and contribute to the future progress of RNA-based therapeutics.We highlight two particular roles of polymers in this context.One represents conjugation of polymers to nucleic acids to form biohybrids.The other is concerned with advanced polymer-based carrier systems for nucleic acids.We believe that polymers can help to address present problems of RNA-based therapeutic technologies and impact the field beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. More than one year since Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, the gold standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is still the RT-qPCR.This is a limitation to increase testing capacities, particularly at developing countries, as expensive reagents and equipment are required.We developed a two steps end point RT-PCR reaction with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) gene and Ribonuclease P (RNase P) specific primers where viral amplicons were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis.We carried out a clinical performance and analytical sensitivity evaluation for this two-steps end point RT-PCR method with 242 nasopharyngeal samples using the CDC RT-qPCR protocol as a gold standard technique.With a specificity of 95.8%, a sensitivity of 95.1%, and a limit of detection of 20 viral RNA copies/uL, this two steps end point RT-PCR assay is an affordable and reliable method for SARS-CoV-2 detection.This protocol would allow to extend COVID-19 diagnosis to basic molecular biology laboratories with a potential positive impact in surveillance programs at developing countries. COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests.Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive.The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage.India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop.227.9 million) and Bihar (pop.121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests.Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met.These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness.We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing.We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met. Reverse vaccinology is an evolving approach for improving vaccine effectiveness and minimizing adverse responses by limiting immunizations to critical epitopes.Towards this goal, we sought to identify immunogenic amino acid motifs and linear epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that elicit IgG in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients.Paired pre/post vaccination samples from N = 20 healthy adults, and post-vaccine samples from an additional N = 13 individuals were used to immunoprecipitate IgG targets expressed by a bacterial display random peptide library, and preferentially recognized peptides were mapped to the spike primary sequence.The data identify several distinct amino acid motifs recognized by vaccine-induced IgG, a subset of those targeted by IgG from natural infection, which may mimic 3-dimensional conformation (mimotopes).Dominant linear epitopes were identified in the C-terminal domains of the S1 and S2 subunits (aa 558-569, 627-638, and 1148-1159) which have been previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization in vitro and demonstrate identity to bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV, but limited homology to non-pathogenic human coronavirus.The identified COVID-19 mRNA vaccine epitopes should be considered in the context of variants, immune escape and vaccine and therapy design moving forward. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all areas of health care and posed unique challenges in managing patient care.COVID-19 precautions were taken in every practice setting.The placement and care of patients with a behavioral health (BH) diagnosis have revealed unforeseen acute care challenges during this pandemic.There were new barriers for acute care hospitals in the timely transition of care of BH patients who tested positive for COVID-19.The purpose of this article is to highlight the challenges encountered by an acute care hospital to provide extended care for BH patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.Immediately following COVID-19 recovery, the patients could not be placed in a licensed BH facility for continued care because of state COVID-19 quarantine executive order and public health mandate for congregate facilities.This mandate resulted in the acute care hospitals in Georgia adapting in real time to provide extended inpatient care for BH patients.This article presents 2 case studies, outlining challenges, interventions, and lessons learned, of how one acute care hospital ensured the best outcomes for extended-stay BH patients admitted with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Data sources A search of electronic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) was carried out, with publication being set from 2019 to October 2020.Study selection Titles and abstracts from the original search were reviewed by two reviewers independently.Overall, 17 studies were included in the final analysis.Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction was conducted independently by two reviewers.Studies that were chosen were examined and the following data parameters were included: age and gender, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, COVID-19 manifestations, treatment for COVID-19, cutaneous lesions, oral manifestations, days after COVID-19 diagnosis, treat/healing or oral symptoms.Results Seventeen studies were included; 14 articles were case reports, two case series and one systematic review.The results showed that dry mouth, dysgeusia, oral ulcerations and opportunistic infections were among the most common oral manifestations expressed in COVID-19-positive patients.Conclusion The authors recommended carrying out careful clinical intraoral examinations on both COVID-19-positive patients or any patients requiring dental care, as oral symptoms can still be the only or initial symptom of COVID-19. The global population is at present suffering from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The goal of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population.To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps.We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant "epitope hotspot" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types.We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses.We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3,400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system.A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome.Finally, we used a database of the HLA haplotypes of approximately 22,000 individuals to develop a "digital twin" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population; the approach identified an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population.By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population. Rapid, high-throughput diagnostic tests are essential to decelerate the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.While RT-PCR tests performed in centralized laboratories remain the gold standard, rapid point-of-care antigen tests might provide faster results.However, they are associated with markedly reduced sensitivity.Bedside breath gas analysis of volatile organic compounds detected by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) may enable a quick and sensitive point-of-care testing alternative.In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether gas analysis by IMS can discriminate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from other respiratory viruses in an experimental set-up.Repeated gas analyses of air samples collected from the headspace of virus-infected in vitro cultures were performed for 5 days.A three-step decision tree using the intensities of four spectrometry peaks correlating to unidentified volatile organic compounds allowed the correct classification of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus-NL63, and influenza A virus H1N1 without misassignment when the calculation was performed with data 3 days post infection.The forward selection assignment model allowed the identification of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity, with only one of 231 measurements (0.43%) being misclassified.Thus, volatile organic compound analysis by IMS allows highly accurate differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses in an experimental set-up, supporting further research and evaluation in clinical studies. A total of 22 patients who had developed an adverse cutaneous reaction to the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine underwent biopsies.Each patient was assessed light microscopically, and, in select biopsies, spike glycoprotein and cytokine assessment were also conducted.The patients developed self-limited cutaneous reactions often described clinically as urticarial or eczematous within 1 day to 4 weeks after receiving the first or second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.Classic clinical and morphologic depictions of type IV cutaneous hypersensitivity with features of eczematous dermatitis, interface dermatitis, granulomatous inflammation, and/or lymphocytic vasculitic component were observed.Clinical and/or histologic features of perniosis, pityriasis rosea, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and guttate psoriasis were seen in select cases.In 2 cases the dominant picture was urticarial vasculitis, possibly reflective of an Arthus type III immune complex action.The biopsy specimens of normal skin post vaccine and of skin affected by the post-vaccine eruption showed rare deep microvessels positive for spike glycoprotein with no complement deposition contrasting with greater vascular deposition of spike protein and complement in skin biopsies from patients experiencing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).It is concluded that self-limited hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine occur possibly owing to a substance found in the vaccine vehicle (eg, polyethylene glycol).An immune response that is directed against human-manufactured spike has to be considered because some of the reactions clinically and or histologically closely resemble mild COVID-19.Finally, vaccine-associated immune enhancement largely attributable to the adjuvant properties of the vaccine may unmask certain inflammatory milieus operational in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and subclinical hypersensitivity. SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US.Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply.Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic.Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/l, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR.While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive.Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold.Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR.These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained. The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 led the Spanish government to impose a national lockdown in an attempt to control the spread of the infection.Mobility restrictions and the requirement of a medical prescription for serological testing for COVID-19 were included among the control measures.Under this scenario, between April 15th and June 15th, 2020, we performed an observational study including 449 individuals allowed to be tested according to the governmental restrictions, i.e.fulfilling the following prescription requirements: manifestation of COVID-19-compatible symptoms, contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, or employment as an essential worker, including health care workers, firefighters and public safety personnel such as police.Importantly, a relevant feature of the studied cohort was that none of the participants had been hospitalized.We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity in this specific cohort, uncovering intrinsic features of great demographic interest.The overall rate of IgG seropositivity was 33.69% (95% CI: 29.27-38.21).This frequency was comparable among the different participant occupations.A RT-PCR positive test, contact with a household member previously tested positive and the presence of COVID-19-compatible symptoms were positively associated with IgG + results.Among these symptoms, ageusia/anosmia was positively and independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, while odynophagia was inversely associated.However, fever, ageusia/anosmia and asthenia were the most frequent symptoms described by IgG + subjects.Therefore, our data illustrate how specific cohorts display particular characteristics that should be taken into account when studying population-wide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and key defining symptoms of COVID-19. Long-term symptoms often associated with COVID-19 (post-COVID conditions or long COVID) are an emerging public health concern that is not well understood.Prevalence of post-COVID conditions has been reported among persons who have had COVID-19 (range = 5%-80%), with differences possibly related to different study populations, case definitions, and data sources (1).Few studies of post-COVID conditions have comparisons with the general population of adults with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, limiting ability to assess background symptom prevalence (1).CDC used a nonprobability-based Internet panel established by Porter Novelli Public Services* to administer a survey to a nationwide sample of U.S. adults aged 18 years to compare the prevalence of long-term symptoms (those lasting >4 weeks since onset) among persons who self-reported ever receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result with the prevalence of similar symptoms among persons who reported always receiving a negative test result.The weighted prevalence of ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.6%-23.8%).Approximately two thirds of respondents who had received a positive test result experienced long-term symptoms often associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, those who received a positive test result reported a significantly higher prevalence of any long-term symptom (65.9% versus 42.9%), fatigue (22.5% versus 12.0%), change in sense of smell or taste (17.3% versus 1.7%), shortness of breath (15.5% versus 5.2%), cough (14.5% versus 4.9%), headache (13.8% versus 9.9%), and persistence (>4 weeks) of at least one initially occurring symptom (76.2% versus 69.6%).Compared with respondents who received a negative test result, a larger proportion of those who received a positive test result reported believing that receiving a COVID-19 vaccine made their long-term symptoms better (28.7% versus 15.7%).Efforts to address post-COVID conditions should include helping health care professionals recognize the most common post-COVID conditions and optimize care for patients with persisting symptoms, including messaging on potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. INTRODUCTION: On December 2020 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.This new vaccine has several side effects that can potentially impair function, which warrants special attention regarding aircrews fitness to fly following vaccination.METHODS: A survey was conducted in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Aeromedical Center in order to characterize the side effects and their duration following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administration to aviators.RESULTS: The most common side effect was injection site pain.Headache, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and weakness were more common following the second dose administration.The difference is statistically significant.Following the second vaccine, duration of side effects was longer compared to the first vaccine (P-value 0.002).CONCLUSION: The IAF Aeromedical center policy for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients among aircrew members, based on side effects duration and severity, is to temporarily ground from flight duties for 24 and 48 h following the first and the second dose, respectively.Gabbai D, Ekshtein A, Tehori O, Ben-Ari O, Shapira S.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities across the globe, the need to contain the spread of the outbreaks is of paramount importance.Wastewater monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent responsible for COVID-19, has emerged as a promising tool for health officials to anticipate outbreaks.As interest in wastewater monitoring continues to grow and municipalities begin to implement this approach, there is a need to further identify and evaluate methods used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA from wastewater samples.Here we evaluate the recovery, cost, and throughput of five different concentration methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in wastewater samples.We tested the five methods on six different wastewater samples.We also evaluated the use of a bovine coronavirus vaccine as a process control and pepper mild mottle virus as a normalization factor.Of the five methods we tested head-to-head, we found that HA filtration with bead beating performed the best in terms of sensitivity and cost.This evaluation can serve as a guide for laboratories establishing a protocol to perform wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is a global public health issue due to its epidemic nature that, to date, lacks pharmacological treatment.However, some COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, although the duration of their protection, their ability to interrupt viral transmission, and their efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being studied.Chiles SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign required design and planning, like any other campaign.This process included the prioritization of risk groups for vaccination given the limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines globally.Throughout 2020, CAVEI issued recommendations on the prioritization of population groups to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 in response to different needs and in accordance with available evidence.These recommendations are consolidated in Table 1 in this report.In summary, it was recommended that healthcare workers, people in long-term residences and essential State personnel be vaccinated in phase 1.In phase 2, persons over 65 years of age and people with comorbidities.In phase 3, essential tasks workers and, lastly, the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 epidemic, caused more than 55 million cases and nearly 1.5 million deaths worldwide.For the microbiological diagnosis of the disease, the most valid method is detecting the presence of the viral genome by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).However, due to the nature of the RNA viruses, frequent mutations may affect the sensitivity of the analyses made on the genetic material of the virus, such as PCR.In this study, we aimed to investigate the mutations in the primer-probe binding regions of the rRT-PCR panels used in COVID-19 diagnosis.SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence data (n= 194) isolated from COVID-19 cases in Turkey and uploaded on GISAID database from the centers in stanbul (n= 78), Ankara (n= 58), Kars (n= 47), Bursa (n= 2), Adyaman (n= 2), Erciyes (n= 1) and Kocaeli (n= 1) between March 17-September 14, 2020 were analyzed.In order to determine the nucleotide changes, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Turkey were compared to the reference genome sequence (NC_045512.1) present in "GenBank" website.The constructed data set was aligned using the MAFFT program and was checked manually if the sequences were in the same frame by using the AliView program.Primer-probe binding sites of the thirteen SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR panels from seven different institutes (US CDC, China CDC, Charite CDC, Pasteur, HKU, Thailand, NIID) that are being used in COVID-19 diagnosis were evaluated in terms of nucleotide changes within the corresponding regions compared to the reference genome.Sequence diversities in the viral genomes were determined via positional nucleotide numerical calculator and entropy calculator modules and nucleotide and entropy changes in primer-probe binding regions for each rRT-PCR panel were examined.Among thirteen different primer-probe panels, nucleotide changes in the target regions of the seven primer-probe panels were determined.When viral sequences with nucleotide changes in the primer-probe binding regions were examined, the most common changes were observed in the "China CDC" N-forward primer and "US CDC" N3-forward primer binding regions.It is important that the kits to be used as diagnostic tests are designed specific to the regions with less nucleotide changes.Nucleotide changes may not be critical for DNA amplification for most PCR panels, but should be carefully monitored as they may affect the sensitivity of the assay.If the risk of alteration of the designed region is high, the primer - probe binding sites should be checked frequently and updated when necessary. Development of a rapidly scalable vaccine is still an urgent task to halt the spread of COVID-19.We have demonstrated biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles (BMSNs) as a good drug delivery carrier for tumor therapy.In this study, seven linear B cell epitopes and three CD8+ T cell epitopes were screened from the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by computer-based immunoinformatic approaches for vaccine design.A nanoparticle-based candidate vaccine (B/T@BMSNs) against SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly prepared by encapsulating these ten epitope peptides within BMSNs, respectively.BMSNs with potential biodegradability, proved to possess excellent safety in vitro and in vivo, could efficiently deliver epitope peptides into the cytoplasm of RAW264.7 cells.Strong Th1-biased humoral and cellular immunity were induced by B/T@BMSNs in mice and all the 10 selected epitopes were identified as effective antigen epitopes, which could induce robust peptide-specific immune response.The elicited functional antibody could bind to the recombinant S protein and block the binding of the S protein to the ACE-2 receptor.These results demonstrate the potential of a nanoparticles vaccine platform based on BMSNs to rapidly develop peptide-based subunit vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Objective: The events of the last year have highlighted the complexity of implementing large-scale molecular diagnostic testing for novel pathogens.The purpose of this study was to determine the chemical influences of sample collection media and storage on the stability and detection of viral nucleic acids by qRT-PCR.We studied the mechanism(s) through which viral transport media (VTM) and number of freeze-thaw cycles influenced the analytical sensitivity of qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.Our goal is to reinforce testing capabilities and identify weaknesses that could arise in resource-limited environments that do not have well-controlled cold chains.Method: The sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis was studied in four VTM for synthetic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) simulants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.Results: The sensitivity and reproducibility of qRT-PCR for the synthetic ssRNA and dsDNA were found to be highly sensitive to VTM with the best results observed for ssRNA in HBSS and PBS-G.Surprisingly, the presence of epithelial cellular material with the ssRNA increased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay.Repeated freeze-thaw cycling decreased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR with two noted exceptions.Conclusions: The choice of VTM is critically important to defining the sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular diagnostics assays and this study suggests they can impact upon the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome.This becomes increasingly important if the virus structure is destabilised before analysis, which can occur due to poor storage conditions.This study suggests that COVID-19 testing performed with glycerol-containing PBS will produce a high level of stability and sensitivity.These results are in agreement with clinical studies reported for patient-derived samples. Widespread acceptance of a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the next major step in fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but achieving high uptake will be a challenge and may be impeded by online misinformation.To inform successful vaccination campaigns, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in the UK and the USA to quantify how exposure to online misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines affects intent to vaccinate to protect oneself or others.Here we show that in both countries-as of September 2020-fewer people would definitely take a vaccine than is likely required for herd immunity, and that, relative to factual information, recent misinformation induced a decline in intent of 6.2 percentage points (95th percentile interval 3.9 to 8.5) in the UK and 6.4 percentage points (95th percentile interval 4.0 to 8.8) in the USA among those who stated that they would definitely accept a vaccine.We also find that some sociodemographic groups are differentially impacted by exposure to misinformation.Finally, we show that scientific-sounding misinformation is more strongly associated with declines in vaccination intent. Immunocompromised persons, defined as those with suppressed humoral or cellular immunity resulting from health conditions or medications, account for approximately 3% of the U.S. adult population (1).Immunocompromised adults are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes (2) and might not acquire the same level of protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as do immunocompetent adults (3,4).To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) among immunocompromised adults, data from the VISION Network* on hospitalizations among persons aged 18 years with COVID-19-like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states during January 17-September 5, 2021 were analyzed.Using selected discharge diagnoses, VE against COVID-19-associated hospitalization conferred by completing a 2-dose series of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 14 days before the index hospitalization date (i.e., being fully vaccinated) was evaluated using a test-negative design comparing 20,101 immunocompromised adults (10,564 [53%] of whom were fully vaccinated) and 69,116 immunocompetent adults (29,456 [43%] of whom were fully vaccinated).VE of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was lower among immunocompromised patients (77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-80%) than among immunocompetent patients (90%; 95% CI = 89%-91%).This difference persisted irrespective of mRNA vaccine product, age group, and timing of hospitalization relative to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance in the state of hospitalization.VE varied across immunocompromising condition subgroups, ranging from 59% (organ or stem cell transplant recipients) to 81% (persons with a rheumatologic or inflammatory disorder).Immunocompromised persons benefit from mRNA COVID-19 vaccination but are less protected from severe COVID-19 outcomes than are immunocompetent persons, and VE varies among immunocompromised subgroups.Immunocompromised persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should receive 3 doses and a booster, consistent with CDC recommendations (5), practice nonpharmaceutical interventions, and, if infected, be monitored closely and considered early for proven therapies that can prevent severe outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe with lingering symptomatology in some.This prompted investigation of whether or not asymptomatic disease results in measurable immune activation post-infection.Immune activation following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterized through a comparative investigation of the immune cell transcriptomes from 43 asymptomatic seropositive and 52 highly exposed seronegative individuals from the same community 4-6 weeks following a superspreading event.Few of the 95 individuals had underlying health issues.One seropositive individual reported Cystic Fibrosis and one individual reported Incontinentia pigmenti.No evidence of immune activation was found in asymptomatic seropositive individuals with the exception of the Cystic Fibrosis patient.There were no statistically significant differences in immune transcriptomes between asymptomatic seropositive and highly exposed seronegative individuals.Four positive controls, mildly symptomatic seropositive individuals whose blood was examined 3 weeks following infection, showed immune activation.Negative controls were four seronegative individuals from neighboring communities without COVID-19.All individuals remained in their usual state of health through a five-month follow-up after sample collection.In summary, whole blood transcriptomes identified individual immune profiles within a community population and showed that asymptomatic infection within a super-spreading event was not associated with enduring immunological activation. The aim of this study was to identify and validate a sensitive, high-throughput, and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay to be used as a surveillance and diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 in a university surveillance program.We conducted a side-by-side clinical evaluation of a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay (EZ-SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR) with the commercial TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which has an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.The EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR incorporates two assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, an internal control targeting the human RNase P gene, and a PCR inhibition control in a single reaction.Nasopharyngeal (NP) and anterior nares (AN) swabs were tested as individuals and pools with both assays and in the ABI 7500 Fast and the QuantStudio 5 detection platforms.The analytical sensitivity of the EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was 250 copies/ml or approximately 1.75 genome copy equivalents per reaction.The clinical performance of the EZ-SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated using NP and AN samples tested in other laboratories.The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay ranged between 94 and 96% across the detection platforms, and the diagnostic specificity was 94.06%.The positive predictive value was 94%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 94 to 96%.Pooling five NP or AN specimens yielded 93% diagnostic sensitivity.The overall agreement between these SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays was high, supported by a Cohens kappa value of 0.93.The EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay performance attributes of high sensitivity and specificity with AN sample matrix and pooled upper respiratory samples support its use in a high-throughput surveillance testing program. With limited clinical resources, burgeoning testing requests from Army and other Service units to clinical laboratories, and the continued spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) throughout the military population, the Army Public Health Laboratory (APHL) Enterprise was tasked to establish surveillance testing capabilities for active duty military populations in an expedient manner.Following a proof-of-concept study conducted by Public Health Command-Pacific, Public Health Command-Europe was the first public health laboratory to offer the capability to assess for SARS-CoV-2 in pooled samples, followed closely by the Army Public Health Center (APHC) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, paralleling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from China to Europe to the continental US.The APHLs have selected pool sizes of up to 10 samples per pool based on the best evidence available at the time of method development and validation.Real-Time quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assays using RNA extracts from pooled nasopharyngeal swabs preserved in viral transport media were selected to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2.The rapid development of initial surveillance testing capabilities depended on existing equipment in each laboratory, with a plan to implement full operational capability using additional staff and common high-throughput platforms.APHL Enterprise has successfully used existing resources to begin to address the changing and complex needs for COVID-19 testing within the Army population.Successful implementation of pooled surveillance testing at the APHC Laboratory has enabled more than 8,600 Soldiers to avoid clinical testing to date.The APHC Laboratory alone has tested over 10,000 samples and prevented approximately 8,600 soldiers from seeking testing with clinical diagnostic assays. There is an urgent and unprecedented need for sensitive and high-throughput molecular diagnostic tests to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Here we present a generalized version of the RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing Selection and Ligation with next generation DNA sequencing (RASL-seq) assay, called "capture RASL-seq" (cRASL-seq), which enables highly sensitive (down to ~1-100 pfu/ml or cfu/ml) and highly multiplexed (up to ~10,000 target sequences) detection of pathogens.Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows.Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence.Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises. Widespread acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for achieving sufficient immunization coverage to end the global pandemic, yet few studies have investigated COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in lower-income countries, where large-scale vaccination is just beginning.We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 survey samples covering 10 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa and South America, Russia (an upper-middle-income country) and the United States, including a total of 44,260 individuals.We find considerably higher willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine in our LMIC samples (mean 80.3%; median 78%; range 30.1 percentage points) compared with the United States (mean 64.6%) and Russia (mean 30.4%).Vaccine acceptance in LMICs is primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects is the most common reason for hesitancy.Health workers are the most trusted sources of guidance about COVID-19 vaccines.Evidence from this sample of LMICs suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunization coverage.Vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake.Messages highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety, delivered by healthcare workers, could be effective for addressing any remaining hesitancy in the analyzed LMICs. As of September 1st 2020, over 42 000 COVID-19 cases and 2 800 COVID-19-related deaths have been confirmed in Ontario, Canada.Testing enables quick identification of cases, which results in effective contact tracing and containment of virus spread.Faced with a lack of surge capacity in the public health laboratory system at the start, health officials implemented changes to testing and laboratory infrastructure to significantly expand testing capacity to include 1) the centralization of resources; and 2) the integration of private and independent labs into the COVID-19 testing program.With these changes, testing capacity has grown from approximately 4,000/day in March to 32,000/day by the end of August, 2020.Eligibility criteria for testing has expanded to increase sensitivity and include testing of asymptomatic individuals.Along with previous outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for integration of testing surge capacity in public health systems before outbreaks occur.This paper details the development and implementation of a COVID-19 testing program in Ontario from January 2020 to September 2020 during the first-wave of the pandemic.The goal of this analysis is to explore the historical precedence, present influences, and future implications of the program. In less than nine months, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) killed over a million people, including >25,000 in New York City (NYC) alone.The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course.To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling.We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease.We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways.In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs.Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs.These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies. The perinatal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still largely unknown.This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City.This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide.Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study.Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease.No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m2, and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women.The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks.All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported.The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05).No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes.SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth.An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2-18] days vs. 2 [2-3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity.This report highlights the importance of COVID-19 detection at delivery in pregnant women living in high transmission areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new and demanding work environment for health professionals.This article will focus on the biological issues related to infection and disease, tests developed based on these biological principles, the ways in which these tests are evaluated, and how they can be used to protect both patients, dental professionals, and office affiliates.The article will describe types of COVID-19 testing that may be performed in dental offices, the issue of testing and anxiety, regulations regarding testing that are relevant to dentists, rules for delivery and reimbursement, and strategies for proceeding as a health professional in the current challenging environment.The authors conclude that the devastating effects of the pandemic on public health has facilitated a new role for dentists as public health professionals, with the opportunity for the dental profession to actively expand its participation in improving the health of the public moving forward.Testing will continue as a means of relieving anxiety for the public. The widespread prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) means that inpatient psychiatric units will necessarily manage patients who have COVID-19 that is comorbid with acute psychiatric symptoms.We report a case of recurrence of respiratory symptoms and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in a patient on an inpatient psychiatric unit occurring 42 days after the initial positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, 38 days after initial symptom resolution, and 30 days after the first of 3 negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests.Over the course of the admission, the patient was safely initiated on clozapine.Recent literature on COVID-19s potential recurrence and neuropsychiatric effects is reviewed and implications for the management of COVID-19 on inpatient psychiatric units are discussed.In the era of COVID-19 and our still-developing understanding of this illness, psychiatrists role as advocates and collaborators in our patients physical health care has become even more critical. Laboratory medicine provides an almost irreplaceable contribution to the diagnostic reasoning and managed care of most human pathologies.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm.Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed.First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels.The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far.As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis.The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays. In this study we explored sociodemographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccine access upon initial rollout at Publix grocery store locations throughout Florida in January 2021.Florida officials reported that they chose Publix stores for the vaccine rollout because the chain has so many stores in the state and was considered at the time to be better prepared than other retailers.Data on education levels, ethnicity, race, percentage at or below the poverty level, and percentage single-parent households were collected from the 2019 census for 974 Florida ZIP codes.We used hotspot analysis to measure spatial clustering of Publix vaccination sites per 100,000 people.We identified hot spots (areas with greater vaccine availability) in moderately populated areas where the population was significantly older, richer, and Whiter than in areas of lower vaccine availability (cold spots).Cold spots were identified in areas of low and high population density, areas with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents, and areas with a higher proportion of single-parent households, including Miami-Dade County and inland regions of Florida.Multivariate analysis showed strong associations between the number of vaccination sites in a ZIP code and race and ethnicity and a weaker association with percentage of residents at or below the poverty level.Future vaccine distribution should continue to be monitored through a socioeconomic lens to help prevent unequal access. Since the first recorded case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020, Brazil has seen an exponential growth in the number of cases and deaths.The national testing approach has been insufficient to correctly use this tool in the support of containing the epidemic in the country.In this communication, we discuss efforts and challenges to scale-up COVID-19 testing at the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS).This communication presents the initial results of the research project created to investigate the political, industrial, technological, and regulatory aspects that may affect the diagnostic and testing capacity for COVID-19 in Brazil.The paper draws on the review of academic literature, media publication, and collection of public data on tests purchase and regulation.It enlists initiatives to enhance PCR testing, national production and development of technologies, as well as regulatory measures to fast-track new tests.Our analysis indicates some points of reflection.Firstly, the lack of a consistent national strategy to fight COVID-19 exarcebated supply problems of diagnostic components.If the country was eventually able to circumvent this situation, it still faces a more structural dependency on the importation of diagnostic components.Secondly, the discontinued funding and distribution of tests may have implied health policy fragmentation and the growing importance of local governments and non-state actors to fighting the epidemics within SUS.Finally, initiatives established since the second semester of 2020 have expanded the testing capacity at SUS.However, it has not been sufficient to control the progress of the epidemic in the country. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine1-3 has demonstrated clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, including against the B.1.351 variant that is partially resistant to neutralizing antibodies1.However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in humans against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern remains unclear.Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I-IIa clinical trial2 against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern.Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 after vaccination.Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020.Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant.CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C variants.These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants.These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Properly conducted serological survey can help determine infection disease true spread.This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Saint Petersburg, Russia accounting for non-response bias.A sample of adults was recruited with random digit dialling, interviewed and invited for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.The seroprevalence was corrected with the aid of the bivariate probit model that jointly estimated individual propensity to agree to participate in the survey and seropositivity.66,250 individuals were contacted, 6,440 adults agreed to be interviewed and blood samples were obtained from 1,038 participants between May 27 and June 26, 2020.Nave seroprevalence corrected for test characteristics was 9.0% (7.2-10.8) by CMIA and 10.5% (8.6-12.4) by ELISA.Correction for non-response decreased estimates to 7.4% (5.7-9.2) and 9.1% (7.2-10.9) for CMIA and ELISA, respectively.The most pronounced decrease in bias-corrected seroprevalence was attributed to the history of any illnesses in the past 3 months and COVID-19 testing.Seroconversion was negatively associated with smoking status, self-reported history of allergies and changes in hand-washing habits.These results suggest that even low estimates of seroprevalence can be an overestimation.Serosurvey design should attempt to identify characteristics that are associated both with participation and seropositivity. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading throughout the world.The study describes 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, who developed an acute erythematous rash with nonfollicular pinhead-sized pustules, without mucosal involvement.The clinical differential diagnosis was viral rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), or multiform erythema.computed tomography with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia and a respiratory tract sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.Patients had signs of respiratory distress and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, heparin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.Punch biopsies showed subcorneal pustules typical of AGEP.Dermal microvascular injury and thrombosis as described in skin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed.The direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgA, IgM, and C3 was negative in 8 patients investigated.A polymerase chain reaction for RNA SARS-CoV-2 performed on frozen skin was negative in 5 of 6 patients.Most of our patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids.After some days (4-10), the diffuse erythema and pustules had improved.AGEP is classified as a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, provoked by drugs and acute infections.Characteristically, removal of the offending agent leads to spontaneous resolution typically in less than 15 days.The recognition of AGEP is important, in order to avoid confusion with a systemic infection and consequently to avoid incorrect treatment.Cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs are common and are major health problems worldwide causing considerable costs for health care systems.We suggest that in the patients with AGEP during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, viral infection is a risk factor for developing drug reaction. The new outbreak caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of 2019 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020.Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus.The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance.In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results.Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches.Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR.The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19.The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests.Nevertheless, more controlled serology cohort studies should be performed as soon as possible to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 testing is required before admission of a patient in the hospitals, invasive procedures, major and minor surgeries etc.Real Time Polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for the diagnosis, but requires well equipped biosafety laboratory along with trained manpower.In this study we have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of novel TrueNat molecular assay for detecting SARS CoV-2.TrueNat is a chip-based real time PCR test and works on portable, light weight, battery powered equipment and can be used in remote areas with poor infrastructure.In this study 1807 patients samples were collected for both TrueNat and RTPCR COVID-19 testing during study period.Of these 174 (9.7%) and 174 (15%) were positive by RTPCR and TrueNat respectively and taking results of RTPCR as gold standard TrueNat test showed a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 69.5, 90.9% and 89.2% respectively.It can be concluded that TrueNat is a simple, easy to use, good rapid molecular diagnostic test for diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in resource limited settings and will prove to be a game changer of molecular diagnostics in future. The SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.Since then, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the healthcare system, including cancer treatments worldwide.Since March 2020 in Japan, cancer patients faced a crisis; they suffered from delays or restrictions in cancer treatment during the initial outbreak.At present, we can perform cancer treatment as usual.Most of the treatments depend on continuous infection control by cancer patients and their families.However, the need to recognize cancer treatment management during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial.Cancer treatment practice, purpose, risk factors, and the evidence during clinical trials should be comprehensively evaluated and adapted for each patient.Moreover, there is a need to discuss care planning between healthcare professionals, patients, and their families in advance.The COVID-19 vaccine could be essential for cancer patients.In this article, we review cancer treatment points for implementing whole-person care, including advanced care planning for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed life on a global scale.The numbers of transplantations have plummeted as a result of fear of disease transmission, recipient coronavirus disease 2019 infection, priority shift, and resource limitations.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) complicates transplantation because donor testing, (re)allocation of limited resources, and recipient testing may exceed permissible ischemia times.Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) helps safely prolong liver preservation up to 38 hours.Additional time is essential under the current circumstances.Here we present the case of a 29-year-old liver transplant recipient in whom prolonged liver preservation required for SARS-CoV-2 screening was accomplished through NMP.Donor and recipient test results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and intensive care unit capacity was eventually available.The surgical procedure and postoperative course were uneventful.NMP can extend preservation times in liver transplantation while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 test results and available intensive care unit capacity. Several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency approval.Here we assess the immunogenicity of a single dose of the AZD1222 vaccine, at one month, in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) (629 nave and 26 previously infected).93.4% of nave HCWs seroconverted, irrespective of age and gender.Haemagglutination test for antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD), surrogate neutralization assay (sVNT) and ex vivo IFN ELISpot assays were carried out in a sub-cohort.ACE2 blocking antibodies (measured by sVNT) were detected in 67/69 (97.1%) of nave HCWs.Antibody levels to the RBD of the wild-type virus were higher than to RBD of B.1.1.7, and titres to B.1.351 were very low.Ex vivo T cell responses were observed in 30.8% to 61.7% in nave HCWs.Previously infected HCWs, developed significantly higher (p < 0.0001) ACE2 blocking antibodies and antibodies to the RBD for the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.This study shows high seroconversion after one vaccine dose, but also suggests that one vaccine dose may be insufficient to protect against emerging variants. Efforts to best protect the world from SARS-CoV-2 as variants emerge and despite limited vaccine supply are ongoing.One strategy that may maximize vaccine coverage and expedite immunization campaigns involves providing single mRNA vaccine doses to individuals with previous COVID-19.In this issue of the JCI, two independent studies, one by Levi and Azzolini et al.and another by Mazzoni and Di Lauria et al., explored vaccine responses in individuals previously infected with the virus.Levi and Azzolini and colleagues used multilinear regression models to correlate exposure and symptoms with antibody response to the vaccine.Mazzoni and Di Lauria and colleagues characterized B cell and T cell kinetics in whole blood after one and two doses of vaccine in health care workers with and without previous infection.Both studies indicated that one vaccine dose may sufficiently protect individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.Implementing a single-dose mRNA vaccine protocol in previously symptomatic individuals may facilitate and expedite immunization campaigns. To evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine in pregnant women, we conducted an observational cohort study of pregnant women aged 16 years or older, with no history of SARS-CoV-2, who were vaccinated between 20 December 2020 and 3 June 2021.A total of 10,861 vaccinated pregnant women were matched to 10,861 unvaccinated pregnant controls using demographic and clinical characteristics.Study outcomes included documented infection with SARS-CoV-2, symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization, severe illness and death.Estimated vaccine effectiveness from 7 through to 56 d after the second dose was 96% (95% confidence interval 89-100%) for any documented infection, 97% (91-100%) for infections with documented symptoms and 89% (43-100%) for COVID-19-related hospitalization.Only one event of severe illness was observed in the unvaccinated group and no deaths were observed in either group.In summary, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was estimated to have high vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women, which is similar to the effectiveness estimated in the general population. Through an unprecedented research and development process, in early 2021, just one year after the COVID-19 pandemic started devastating the world, there are several vaccines commercially available or in advances phase of testing, each with its own characteristics and challenges.For the first time in the history of vaccination, a global immunization program has started at a time of intense pandemic activity characterized by high virus transmission, facilitating selection of variants potentially able to escape the vaccine-induced antibody response.The reality is that one cannot rely on a single vaccine when dealing with a pandemic emergency: the urgent need of billions of doses clashes with the production capacity of the pharmaceutical industry.There is therefore no ideal vaccine, but there are many good vaccines to be used immediately.The current international debate about COVID-19 vaccines is today the hottest topic in global health whether it relates to technical and scientific issues or to the ethical aspects of access to vaccinations for all.This article aims at reviewing the status of vaccines that are used, or about to be used, in immunization campaigns worldwide. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency requiring urgent development of efficacious vaccines.While concentrated research efforts have focused primarily on antibody-based vaccines that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and several first-generation vaccines have either been approved or received emergency use authorization, it is forecasted that COVID-19 will become an endemic disease requiring updated second-generation vaccines.The SARS-CoV-2 surface spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e., neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor-binding domain.Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis.We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them.These results are compared against existing experimental data and used to elucidate the impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and their associated antibody binding behavior.We construct a SARS-CoV-2 antigenic map and offer predictions about the neutralization capabilities of antibody and S mutant combinations based on protein dynamic signatures.We then compare SARS-CoV-2 S protein dynamics to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to investigate differing antibody binding and cellular fusion mechanisms that may explain the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.The outbreaks associated with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 over the last two decades suggest that the threat presented by coronaviruses is ever-changing and long term.Our results provide insights into the dynamics-driven mechanisms of immunogenicity associated with coronavirus S proteins and present a new, to our knowledge, approach to characterize and screen potential mutant candidates for immunogen design, as well as to characterize emerging natural variants that may escape vaccine-induced antibody responses. Given the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of medical resource, extensive deep learning models have been proposed for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis, based on 3D computed tomography (CT) scans.However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks.In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction.Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP).Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis.Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets.Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution.Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy. Large-scale digital flu vaccine campaigns have experienced difficulty increasing vaccination coverage among African Americans and Hispanics, and are routinely inundated by negative responses from vaccine opponents.A digital campaign employing user-generated content from social media micro influencers who are predominantly followed by African Americans and Hispanics was implemented during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 flu seasons to disseminate positive information about the flu vaccine.At the time, this constituted the largest influencer-driven health campaign focused on these communities in the United States.Comments on posts were qualitatively coded to determine content perceptions among those exposed to posts.Digital metrics were also analyzed.During Year 1, posts reached 9 million+ social media users and generated 64 612 likes or shares, and 1512 responses.In Year 2, posts reached 8 million+ users and generated 155 600 likes or shares, and 3122 responses.Around 94% of public responses to posts were positive, suggesting this is a promising strategy to communicate health information and could shift social norms, particularly for heavily debated topics such as vaccination.This strategy represents a more community-led and participatory approach than most large-scale vaccination campaigns have attempted, with immediate applicability to communications about the COVID-19 vaccine. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused 2.69 million deaths and 122 million infections.Great efforts have been made worldwide to promptly develop effective vaccines and reduce morbidity and mortality rates from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Available vaccines have proven highly effective at preventing symptomatic disease in clinical trials and real-world reports and are playing an essential role in flattening the epidemiology curve and, mostly, in reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations.Some concerns have been raised after very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recently reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as potentially associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations, namely the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) and the Moderna mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273).Therefore, the aim of this document is to explore the possible link between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the development of myocarditis and/or pericarditis by performing a critical analysis of available data and to provide indications for specific subgroups of individuals. Kidney transplant recipients and dialysis patients constitute a risk group for severe COVID-19.They are highly advised to get vaccinated according to the current guidelines.However, data on antibody response, cell responses and protection from events, and factors that might alter this response after a routine full series of vaccination remain incomplete for these populations.The aim of this article was to analyze the antibody responses after a full series of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplantation and dialysis patients and to define the factors that alter seroconversion status in these populations.In this systematic review, 18 studies investigating the antibody response to full vaccination with two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant patients were included.Kidney transplant and dialysis patients have a lower seroconversion rate after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than the healthy population: 27.2% for kidney transplantation, 88.5% for dialysis patients while all healthy control in these studies seroconverted.Moreover, anti-S antibody titers were lower in seroconverted kidney transplantation or dialysis patients than in healthy control in all studies that assessed this variable.Older age and dialysis vintage, immunosuppressive or chemotherapy treatment, and lower serum albumin, white blood cell, lymphocyte and hemoglobin counts were associated with lower/no antibody response to vaccination.Dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients have lower seroconversion rates after a full series of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than the general population.Several factors are associated with an altered antibody response.A third dose could be considered in this patient group. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by clinical manifestations such as pneumonia, lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory distress, and cytokine storm.S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-II) to enter into the lungs through membrane proteases consequently inflicting the extensive viral load through rapid replication mechanisms.Despite several research efforts, challenges in COVID-19 management still persist at various levels that include (a) availability of a low cost and rapid self-screening test, (b) lack of an effective vaccine which works against multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, and (c) lack of a potent drug that can reduce the complications of COVID-19.The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a complicated process due to the emergence of mutant variants with greater virulence and their ability to invoke intricate lung pathophysiology.Moreover, the lack of a thorough understanding about the virus transmission mechanisms and complete pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is making it hard for medical scientists to develop a better strategy to prevent the spread of the virus and design a clinically viable vaccine to protect individuals from being infected.A recent report has tested the hypothesis of T cell immunity and found effective when compared to the antibody response in agammaglobulinemic patients.Understanding SARS-CoV-2-induced changes such as "Th-2 immunopathological variations, mononuclear cell & eosinophil infiltration of the lung and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)" in COVID-19 patients provides key insights to develop potential therapeutic interventions for immediate clinical management.Therefore, in this review, we have described the details of rapid detection methods of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular and serological tests and addressed different therapeutic modalities used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.In addition, the current challenges against the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are also briefly described in this article. There is limited understanding of the viral antibody fingerprint following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children.Herein, SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide immunoprofiling of children with mild/moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children versus hospitalized control patients revealed differential cytokine responses, IgM/IgG/IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding and avidity.Apart from spike and nucleocapsid, IgG/IgA recognized epitopes in nonstructural protein (NSP) 2, NSP3, NSP12-NSP14 and open reading frame (ORF) 3a-ORF9.Peptides representing epitopes in NSP12, ORF3a and ORF8 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnosis.Antibody-binding kinetics with 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed antibody parameters that distinguish children with mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.Antibody avidity to prefusion spike correlated with decreased illness severity and served as a clinical disease indicator.The fusion peptide and heptad repeat 2 region induced SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits.Thus, we identified SARS-CoV-2 antibody signatures in children associated with disease severity and delineate promising serodiagnostic and virus neutralization targets.These findings might guide the design of serodiagnostic assays, prognostic algorithms, therapeutics and vaccines in this important but understudied population. To compare clinical and imaging features between patients with an initial negative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test and patients with an initial positive RT-PCR test.CT follow-up analysis in the negative RT-PCR group is also described.Thirty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, with 216 lesions upon CT, were included.Demographic information and chest CT imaging features were collected.The average age in the whole study group was 46.9 11.1 years, with 18 males and 15 females.Patients in the positive RT-PCR test group were more likely to have a fever than patients in the negative RT-PCR test group (85.7% vs 50%, P < .05).Lesions in the positive group were more likely to be located in the peripheral area than lesions in the negative group (83.6% vs 68.2%, P < .05).Regarding the appearance of 216 lesions, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (43.2%) was the most common appearance in the negative group, followed by pure GGOs (31.8%), while in the positive group, pure GGOs (32%) and GGOs with interlobular septal thickening (32.8%) were both most frequent, and the difference between them was evident (P < .05).For the follow-up analysis, the largest short-axis of a lesion was smaller upon follow-up (median size 13.6 mm vs 14 mm), albeit by a smaller margin.Pure GGOs decreased in frequency, from 31.3% to 21.3%, while consolidation increased in frequency, from 7.5% to 12.5%.The manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with a first negative RT-PCR test and patients with a positive first RT-PCR test are different to some extent.The consolidation component may increase after follow-up. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to global public health.Rapid development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines are imperative to control the pandemic.In the current study, we applied our adjuvanted stable prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-2P)-based vaccine, MVC-COV1901, to hamster models to demonstrate immunogenicity and protection from virus challenge.Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 g or 5 g of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2.Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups.Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals.Vaccination with either 1 g or 5 g of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection.This study builds upon our previous results to support the clinical development of MVC-COV1901 as a safe, highly immunogenic, and protective COVID-19 vaccine. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections often cause only mild disease that may evoke relatively low Ab titers compared with patients admitted to hospitals.Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity.Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays.Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14).In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients.Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive.In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently.Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays.In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 million deaths globally, raising a major health concern.To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions.The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes.Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed.Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time.Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods.This review aims to present the current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and rapid. In the context of epidemiology, policies for disease control are often devised through a mixture of intuition and brute-force, whereby the set of logically conceivable policies is narrowed down to a small family described by a few parameters, following which linearization or grid search is used to identify the optimal policy within the set.This scheme runs the risk of leaving out more complex (and perhaps counter-intuitive) policies for disease control that could tackle the disease more efficiently.In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters.In contrast to past approaches for policy optimization based on control theory, our framework can deal with arbitrary uncertainties on the initial conditions and model parameters controlling the spread of the disease, and stochastic models.In addition, our methods allow for optimization over policies which remain constant over weekly periods, specified by either continuous or discrete (e.g.: lockdown on/off) government measures.We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al.(March, 2020). Rapid and clinically sensitive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) play an important role in the contact tracing and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.A recently developed field-deployable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) detection assay with lateral flow strips shows promise for point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2.However, the limit of detection of paper strip-based assays (10-100 copies/L) is much lower than that of fluorescence-based detection methods.In this study, we developed an easy-readout and sensitive enhanced (ERASE) strip to visualize the results of CRISPR detection and improve the sensitivity to 1 copy/L with an unambiguous easy-read result.Using 649 clinical samples from blind specimens collected from patients in China, we validated our ERASE assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with 90.67% positive predictive agreement and 99.21% negative predictive agreement.In conclusion, our study provided a customized CRISPR strip for use in a simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, and highly specific assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.(Clinical Trial Registration number: 2020-008-01; [2020]IEC(ZD01); PJ-NBEY-2020-009-01; 2020#34). The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat causing worldwide morbidity and mortality.Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection.Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples, the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples.Here, we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions to achieve specific, rapid (30 min), and sensitive (<100 copies) fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples.When compared to RT-qPCR, positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98% (n = 41/42) concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87% (n = 59/68) concordance for the same samples.Importantly, the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR.We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WA1/2020), and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR.RT-LAMP has several advantages over RT-qPCR including isothermal amplification, speed (<30 min), reduced costs, and similar sensitivity and specificity. COVID-19 global cases have climbed to more than 33 million, with over a million total deaths, as of September, 2020.Real-time massive SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is key to tracking chains of transmission and estimating the origin of disease outbreaks.Yet no methods have simultaneously achieved high precision, simple workflow, and low cost.We developed a high-precision, cost-efficient SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing platform for COVID-19 genomic surveillance, CorvGenSurv (Coronavirus Genomic Surveillance).CorvGenSurv directly amplified viral RNA from COVID-19 patients Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens and sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome in three segments by long-read, high-throughput sequencing.Sequencing of the whole genome in three segments significantly reduced sequencing data waste, thereby preventing dropouts in genome coverage.We validated the precision of our pipeline by both control genomic RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing.We produced near full-length whole genome sequences from individuals who were COVID-19 test positive during April to June 2020 in Los Angeles County, California, USA.These sequences were highly diverse in the G clade with nine novel amino acid mutations including NSP12-M755I and ORF8-V117F.With its readily adaptable design, CorvGenSurv grants wide access to genomic surveillance, permitting immediate public health response to sudden threats. Quantitative viral load assays have transformed our understanding of viral diseases.They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available.SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time RT-PCR, yield semiquantitative results only.Droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification.Eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR; three were identified as the most efficient, precise, and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification.For example, the analytical efficiency for the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set was approximately 83%, whereas assay precision, measured as the coefficient of variation, was approximately 2% at 1000 input copies/reaction.Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively.SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo.RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers were further calibrated against cycle threshold values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform.This log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from cycle threshold values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology. The world is facing an exceptional pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.To allow the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, several assays based on the real-time PCR technique have been proposed.The requests for diagnosis are such that it was immediately clear that the choice of the most suitable method for each microbiology laboratory had to be based, on the one hand, on the availability of materials, and on the other hand, on the personnel and training priorities for this activity.Unfortunately, due to high demand, the shortage of commercial diagnostic kits has also become a major problem.To overcome these critical issues, we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe.Our system detects three genes-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)-and uses the -actin gene as an endogenous internal control.The results from our assay are in complete agreement with the results obtained using a commercially available kit, except for two samples that did not pass the endogenous internal control.The coincidence rate was 0.96.The LoD of our assay was 140 cp/reaction for N and 14 cp/reaction for RdRp and E. Our kit was designed to be open, either for the nucleic acid extraction step or for the RT-PCR assay, and to be carried out on several instruments.Therefore, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems, and conversely, it is hypothetically available for distribution in large quantities to any microbiological laboratory.The kit is currently distributed worldwide (called MOLgen-COVID-19; Adaltis).A new version of the kit for detecting the S gene is also available. BACKGROUND This retrospective study aimed to describe the effects of convalescent plasma therapy in 24 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during February and March 2020 in Wuhan, China.MATERIAL AND METHODS The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and laboratory test reports of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received a convalescent plasma transfusion.RESULTS A total of 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were transfused with ABO-compatible convalescent plasma were enrolled in the study.Convalescent plasma transfusion showed an effective clinical outcome in 14 of 24 patients (an effective rate of 58.3%).No patients had an adverse reaction to the transfusion.Compared with before convalescent plasma transfusion, the lymphocyte count after convalescent plasma transfusion increased to a normal level (median: 0.8010/L vs. 1.1210/L, P=0.004).Other laboratory indicators such as white blood cells, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase showed a decreasing trend after transfusion.CONCLUSIONS This retrospective observational clinical study showed that convalescent plasma therapy could have beneficial effects on patient outcomes.Recently, regulatory authorization has been given for the use of convalescent plasma therapy, and clinical guidelines have been developed for the collection and use of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin in patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic is probably the most devastating worldwide challenge in recent century.COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019.Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests.Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease.While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance.The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patients serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG.Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis.Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection.Although the serological tests may not play an important role in the active case of COVID-19, it could be effective to determine the immunity of health care workers, and confirm late COVID-19 cases during the outbreak.In this review, we compared various laboratory diagnostic assays for COVID-19. The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied.A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR).By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia.The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87).One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma.There was no reduction in the blood viral load in all critical patients, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load.The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts.Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital.Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up.Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection.Quantitative determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a world-wide crisis.To contain the virus, it is important to find infected individuals and isolate them to stop transmission.Various diagnostic techniques are used to check for infection.With the havoc that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created, it is imperative to work on alternative diagnostic techniques that can be used at both point of care with little or no expertise and at mass testing (i.e., when screening).Despite extensive research, to this date no specific effective treatment or cure is available to neutralize this viral infection.Globally, researchers are working to develop effective treatments, and several vaccines have been approved for public use.We found the studies that we explored for this review using appropriate key words for indexing in PubMed and Google Scholar from 2019 to 2020.We compile various techniques that have been used worldwide to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 and discuss novel methods that may be modified for use in diagnosis and treatment.It is crucial to develop a more specific serological test for diagnosis that can rule out the possibility of COVID-19 and be used for mass testing.An affordable, safe, targeted, effective treatment must be developed to cure this disease, which has created a public health emergency of international concern. There are no standardized methods for collecting and reporting coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) data.We aimed to compare the proportion of patients admitted for COVID-19-related symptoms and those admitted for other reasons who incidentally tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Retrospective cohort studyData were sampled twice weekly between March 26 and June 6, 2020 from a "COVID-19 dashboard," a system-wide administrative database that includes the number of hospitalized patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test.Patient charts were subsequently reviewed and the principal reason for hospitalization abstracted.Data collected during a statewide lockdown revealed that 92 hospitalized patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results.Among these individuals, 4.3% were hospitalized for reasons other than COVID-19-related symptoms but were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive.After the lockdown was suspended, the total inpatient census of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients increased to 128, 20.3% of whom were hospitalized for non-COVID-19-related complaints.In the absence of a statewide lockdown, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients admitted for non-COVID-19-related complaints who were incidentally found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive.In order to ensure data integrity, coding should distinguish between patients with COVID-19-related symptoms and asymptomatic patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Highly sensitive, specific, and point-of-care (POC) serological assays are an essential tool to manage coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Here, we report on a microfluidic POC test that can profile the antibody response against multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens-spike S1 (S1), nucleocapsid (N), and the receptor binding domain (RBD)-simultaneously from 60 l of blood, plasma, or serum.We assessed the levels of antibodies in plasma samples from 31 individuals (with longitudinal sampling) with severe COVID-19, 41 healthy individuals, and 18 individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections.This POC assay achieved high sensitivity and specificity, tracked seroconversion, and showed good concordance with a live virus microneutralization assay.We can also detect a prognostic biomarker of severity, IP-10 (interferon--induced protein 10), on the same chip.Because our test requires minimal user intervention and is read by a handheld detector, it can be globally deployed to combat COVID-19. Rapid antigen (Ag) tests for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provide quick results, do not require specialized technical skills or infrastructure, and can be used as a point-of-care method to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).The performance of a magnetic force-assisted electrochemical immunoassay-based test, namely the MARK-B COVID-19 Ag test (BBB, Sungnam, Republic of Korea), was evaluated using 170 nasopharyngeal swab specimens and compared to that of RT-PCR and commercial rapid Ag test (STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, SD Biosensor, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea).The overall sensitivity and specificity of the MARK-B test were 90.0% (95% CI 79.4%-96.2%) and 99.0% (95% CI 95.0%-99.9%), respectively, with a kappa coefficient of 0.908.The correlations between the electrical current values of MARK-B and the Ct values of RT-PCR were -0.898 (E gene, 95% CI -0.938 to -0.834) and -0.914 (RdRp gene, 95% CI -0.948 to -0.860), respectively.The limit of detection of the MARK-B was measured using the viral culture reference samples and found to be 1 x 102 pfu/mL.The magnetic force-assisted electrochemical immunoassay-based Ag test can be used to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the corresponding fully automated portable device can provide easy readability and semi-quantitative results. Widespread testing is required to limit the current public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Multiple tests protocols have been authorized by the food and drugs administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization (EUA).The majority of these protocols are based on the gold-standard RT-qPCR test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).However, there is still a widespread lack of testing in the US and many of the clinical diagnostics protocols require extensive human labor and materials that could face supply shortages and present biosafety concerns.Given the need to develop alternative reagents and approaches to provide nucleic-acid testing in the face of heightened demand and potential shortages, we have developed a simplified SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol adapted for its use in research laboratories with minimal molecular biology equipment and expertise.The protocol utilizes TRIzol to purify the viral RNA from different types of clinical specimens, requires minimal BSL-1 precautions and, given its high sensitivity, can be easily adapted to pooling samples strategies. The surge of SARS-CoV-2 has challenged health systems worldwide and efficient tests to detect viral particles, as well as antibodies generated against them, are needed.Specificity, sensitivity, promptness or scalability are the main parameters to estimate the final performance, but rarely all of them match in a single test.We have developed SCOVAM, a protein microarray with several viral antigens (spike, nucleocapsid, main protease Nsp5) as capturing probes in a fluorescence immunoassay for COVID-19 serological testing.SCOVAM depicts IgG and IgM antibody responses against each of these proteins of 22 individuals in a single microscope slide.It detects specific IgM (0.094 g ml-1 ) and IgG (~0.017 g ml-1 ) and is scalable and cost-effective.We validated SCOVAM by comparing with a widely used chemiluminescent commercial serological test (n = 742).SCOVAM showed twice the sensitivity and allowed following seroconversion in a single assay.By analysing the prevalence 4 months later in a subset of 76 positive sera, we still detected 93.42% of positives, almost doubling the detection of the commercial assay.The higher sensitivity of SCOVAM is especially relevant to screen sera for convalescent plasma-based treatments, high-throughput antibody response monitoring after vaccination or evaluation of vaccine efficiency. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented need for RT-qPCR-based molecular diagnostic testing, placing a strain on the supply chain and the availability of commercially available PCR testing kits and reagents.The effect of limited molecular diagnostics-related supplies has been felt across the globe, disproportionally impacting molecular diagnostic testing in developing countries where acquisition of supplies is limited due to availability.The increasing global demand for commercial molecular diagnostic testing kits and reagents has made standard PCR assays cost prohibitive, resulting in the development of alternative approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens, circumventing the need for commercial diagnostic testing kits while mitigating the high-demand for molecular diagnostics testing.The timely availability of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated the rapid development and deployment of specific primers and standardized laboratory protocols for the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.An alternative method offering a highly specific manner of detecting and genotyping pathogens within clinical specimens is based on the melting temperature differences of PCR products.This method is based on the melting temperature differences between purine and pyrimidine bases.Here, RT-qPCR assays coupled with a High Resolution Melting analysis (HRM-RTqPCR) were developed to target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (RdRp, E and N) and an internal control (human RNAse P gene).The assays were validated using synthetic sequences from the viral genome and clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, serum and saliva) of sixty-five patients with severe or moderate COVID-19 from different states within Brazil; a larger validation group than that used in the development to the commercially available TaqMan RT-qPCR assay which is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing.The sensitivity of the HRM-RTqPCR assays targeting the viral N, RdRp and E genes were 94.12, 98.04 and 92.16%, with 100% specificity to the 3 SARS-CoV-2 genome targets, and a diagnostic accuracy of 95.38, 98.46 and 93.85%, respectively.Thus, HRM-RTqPCR emerges as an attractive alternative and low-cost methodology for the molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in restricted-budget laboratories. Studies concerning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in paediatrics are limited to children mainly selected from hospitals, where patients with complications and co-morbidities are managed.We aimed to describe the course of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a population of children enrolled by place of residence, from diagnosis to recovery, with a long-term clinical and serological follow-up.We identified patients aged <14 years old living in the Turin Health District 3 who had SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one nasopharyngeal swab from 1st March to 1st June 2020.Epidemiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected by way of a telephone inquiry.Enrolled patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology in order to provide evidence of seroconversion and persistence of specific antibodies some time after the infection.A total of 46 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 were identified.The main pattern of viral transmission was intra-family.Eleven children were totally asymptomatic.If symptoms appeared, the disease had a mild course.A single case of COVID-19-related respiratory insufficiency was registered.Among children who underwent serological evaluation, 84% had seroconversion.No significant differences in antibody development were found according to the age and the burden of the disease.Children tested farther from the primary infection had lower antibody index titre values than the others.In conclusion, COVID-19 has a good prognosis in paediatric age.Children are able to develop a valid immune response, although their index titres seem to decrease a long time after the disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemics.To facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, various RT-LAMP assays using 19 sets of primers had been developed, but never been compared.We performed comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients.Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples.Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13 and Set-17 (75.9%).Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (Tt value < 8.5 min), followed by Set-17 (Tt value < 12.5 min).Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, were determined to be better than the other primer sets.Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-4 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-14, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) were recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is a global pandemic.Therefore, rapid and accurate tests for SARS-CoV-2 screening are urgently needed to expedite disease prevention and control especially in community transmission.Since late December 2020, Thailand has faced a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks.The Thai National Disease Control program at the Ministry of Public Health has identified suitable measure for mass screening.A SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based assay is a surveillance option for active cases.Here, we evaluated the feasibility and test performance of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test during our field activities in 1,100 asymptomatic individuals in Samut Sakhon, Thailand, during the second wave COVID-19 outbreak (December 26-30, 2020).The results showed that the rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 47.97% (95% CI: 36.10-59.96%) and a specificity of 99.71% (95% CI: 99.15-99.94%) versus standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.The rapid test performed better in cases with higher viral loads determined by the cycle threshold value.In real-world setting, the test performance can be compromised by several factors including viral loads, logistic chains, temperature, technical expertise of the operators, validity, and accuracy of the testing itself.Our study highlights a prerequisite for reevaluation of any given testing before implementing it at the national level. Continuous rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, since it was first diagnosed in 2019, forced the entire medical fraternity to delay elective surgeries.The preoperative evaluation guidelines that were used in the pre-COVID-19 era underwent significant changes, adding modifications to meet the post-COVID patients specific criteria and requirements.Currently, all patients before or at the time of hospital admission were tested using a nasopharyngeal swab, by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.Apart from this, for a patient undergoing elective surgery in their post-COVID-19 period, it is mandatory to obtain a detailed history of COVID-19 disease/SARS-CoV-2 infection, to identify residual symptoms or any organ dysfunction the infection might have caused.As well as the functional optimization of the patient to achieve the best clinical and biological status before the surgery.After all the systems have been thoroughly investigated, the risk-benefit ratio needs to be calculated, keeping in mind the cytokine storm and inflammatory responses encountered postoperatively.A mere negative RT-PCR test cannot be considered as the only decisive factor to operate, as the post-COVID-19 phase can influence postoperative outcome of the patient.Hence, the pre-operative evaluation protocols of post-COVID patients should be set and followed thoroughly, in order to avoid post-surgical complications.For better surgical and post-surgical management of post-COVID-19 patients, conducting clinical tests, assessing previously administered medications, evaluating the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxes, and identifying subclinical inflammatory state are the measures that should be taken. The need for rapid, accurate, and scalable testing systems for COVID-19 diagnosis is clear and urgent.Here, we report a rapid Scalable and Portable Testing (SPOT) system consisting of a rapid, highly sensitive, and accurate assay and a battery-powered portable device for COVID-19 diagnosis.The SPOT assay comprises a one-pot reverse transcriptase-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) followed by PfAgo-based target sequence detection.It is capable of detecting the N gene and E gene in a multiplexed reaction with the limit of detection (LoD) of 0.44 copies/L and 1.09 copies/L, respectively, in SARS-CoV-2 virus-spiked saliva samples within 30 min.Moreover, the SPOT system is used to analyze 104 clinical saliva samples and identified 28/30 (93.3% sensitivity) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (100% sensitivity if LoD is considered) and 73/74 (98.6% specificity) SARS-CoV-2 negative samples.This combination of speed, accuracy, sensitivity, and portability will enable high-volume, low-cost access to areas in need of urgent COVID-19 testing capabilities. The first laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Zambia were detected in March 2020 (1).Beginning in July, the number of confirmed cases began to increase rapidly, first peaking during July-August, and then declining in September and October (Figure).After 3 months of relatively low case counts, COVID-19 cases began rapidly rising throughout the country in mid-December.On December 18, 2020, South Africa published the genome of a SARS-CoV-2 variant strain with several mutations that affect the spike protein (2).The variant included a mutation (N501Y) associated with increased transmissibility., SARS-CoV-2 lineages with this mutation have rapidly expanded geographically.,** The variant strain (PANGO [Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak] lineage B.1.351) was first detected in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa from specimens collected in early August, spread within South Africa, and appears to have displaced the majority of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in that country (2).As of January 10, 2021, eight countries had reported cases with the B.1.351 variant.In Zambia, the average number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases increased 16-fold, from 44 cases during December 1-10 to 700 during January 1-10, after detection of the B.1.351 variant in specimens collected during December 16-23.Zambia is a southern African country that shares substantial commerce and tourism linkages with South Africa, which might have contributed to the transmission of the B.1.351 variant between the two countries. Public health interventions such as social distancing and mask wearing decrease the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but it is unclear whether they decrease the viral load of infected patients and whether changes in viral load impact mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We evaluated 6923 patients with COVID-19 at six New York City hospitals from March 15-May 14, 2020, corresponding with the implementation of public health interventions in March.We assessed changes in cycle threshold (CT) values from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests and in-hospital mortality and modeled the impact of viral load on mortality.Mean CT values increased between March and May, with the proportion of patients with high viral load decreasing from 47.7% to 7.8%.In-hospital mortality increased from 14.9% in March to 28.4% in early April, and then decreased to 8.7% by May.Patients with high viral loads had increased mortality compared to those with low viral loads (adjusted odds ratio 2.34).If viral load had not declined, an estimated 69 additional deaths would have occurred (5.8% higher mortality).SARS-CoV-2 viral load steadily declined among hospitalized patients in the setting of public health interventions, and this correlated with decreases in mortality. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT).The performance of Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection (LOD) has become high priority.Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies.Additionally, the LOD using dry swab was investigated after 7 days storage at - 80 C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions.An LOD of 5.0 102 pfu/ml (1.0 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the World Health Organization.Fourteen of 19 Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied to the Ag-RDT.Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at - 80 C for 7 days.Here, we provide analytical sensitivity data to guide appropriate test and sample type selection for use and for future Ag-RDT evaluations. The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide.To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide.A reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for the study of limit of detection (LoD), which is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay.Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with an accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure.Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as a viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms.The median of the quantification results (4.6 105 6.5 104 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard.This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays.Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a rapid and inexpensive isothermal alternative to the current gold standard reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).However, unlike RT-qPCR, there are no consensus detection regions or optimal RT-LAMP methods, and most protocols do not include internal controls to ensure reliability.Naked RNAs, plasmids, or even RNA from infectious COVID-19 patients have been used as external positive controls for RT-LAMP assays, but such reagents lack the stability required for full-process control.To overcome the lack of proper internal and external positive controls and the instability of the detection RNA, we developed virus-like particles (VLPs) using bacteriophage Q and plant virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) for the encapsidation of target RNA, namely a so-called SARS-CoV-2 LAMP detection module (SLDM).The target RNA is a truncated segment of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene and human RNase P gene (internal control) as positive controls for RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP.Target RNAs stably encapsidated in Q and CCMV VLPs were previously shown to function as full-process controls in RT-qPCR assays, and here we show that SLDMs can fulfill the same function for RT-LAMP and swab-to-test (direct RT-LAMP with heat lysis) assays.The SLDM was validated in a clinical setting, highlighting the promise of VLPs as positive controls for molecular assays. The need for tools that facilitate rapid detection and continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is greater than ever, as these variants are more transmissible and therefore increase the pressure of COVID-19 on healthcare systems.To address this demand, we aimed at developing and evaluating a robust and fast diagnostic approach for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 VOC-associated spike gene mutations.Our diagnostic assays detect the E484K and N501Y single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as a spike gene deletion (HV69/70) and can be run on standard laboratory equipment or on the portable rapid diagnostic technology platform peakPCR.The assays achieved excellent diagnostic performance when tested with RNA extracted from culture-derived SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages and clinical samples collected in Equatorial Guinea, Central-West Africa.Simplicity of usage and the relatively low cost are advantages that make our approach well suitable for decentralized and rapid testing, especially in resource-limited settings. During 2020 and 2021, the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in high death rates and acute and chronic morbidity in all countries.The rapid development of new mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 brings hope that the spread of this virus can be controlled.The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine developed by a collaboration between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca showed efficacy in clinical trials, with a good safety profile.However, there have been recent reports of the rare development of thrombotic events in young women following vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, particularly of the rare condition of cavernous sinus thrombosis.Studies have begun to in- vestigate whether antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike cross-react with platelet factor 4 (PF4/CXLC4) and mim- ic autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.This Medical Science Monitor Editorial aims to briefly update the current status of studies on a possible rare complication of using new mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Here, we aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of a novel automated immunoassay HISCL SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay kit designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).This kit comprises automated chemiluminescence detection systems.Western blot analysis confirmed that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies detected SARS-CoV-2N proteins.The best cut-off index was determined, and clinical performance was tested using 115 serum samples obtained from 46 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 69 individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).The HISCL Antigen assay kit showed a sensitivity of 95.4% and 16.6% in samples with copy numbers > 100 and < 99, respectively.The kit did not cross-react with human coronaviruses causing seasonal common cold and influenza, and none of the 69 individuals without COVID-19 were diagnosed with positive results.Importantly, 81.8% of the samples with low virus load (< 50 copy numbers) were diagnosed as negative.Thus, using HISCL antigen assay kits may reduce overdiagnosis compared with RT-qPCR tests.The rapid and high-throughput HISCL SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay kit developed here proved suitable for screening infectious COVID-19 and may help control the pandemic. Tests used to diagnose illness commonly have imperfect accuracy, with some false-positive and negative results.For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest.Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill.Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill.The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity.Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result.Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result.Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a persons illness status.These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness.There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19.This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence.I explain the problem and show how to bound PPV and NPV as well as the risk ratio and difference, which are functions thereof.I apply the findings to COVID-19 antibody tests.I question the realism of supposing that sensitivity and specificity are known. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are a non-specific high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding tipically observed in early Coronavirus disesase 19 (COVID-19) pneumonia.However, GGOs are also seen in other acute lung diseases, thus making challenging the differential diagnosis.To this aim, we investigated the performance of a radiomics-based machine learning method to discriminate GGOs due to COVID-19 from those due to other acute lung diseases.Two sets of patients were included: a first set of 28 patients (COVID) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March and April 2020 having (a) baseline HRCT at hospital admission and (b) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT; a second set of 30 patients (nCOVID) showing (a) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT performed between August 2019 and April 2020 and (b) availability of final diagnosis.Two readers independently segmented GGOs on HRCTs using a semi-automated approach, and radiomics features were extracted using a standard open source software (PyRadiomics).Partial least square (PLS) regression was used as the multivariate machine-learning algorithm.A leave-one-out nested cross-validation was implemented.PLS -weights of radiomics features, including the 5% features with the largest -weights in magnitude (top 5%), were obtained.The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.The Youdens test assessed sensitivity and specificity of the classification.A null hypothesis probability threshold of 5% was chosen (p < 0.05).The predictive model delivered an AUC of 0.868 (Youdens index = 0.68, sensitivity = 93%, specificity 75%, p = 4.2 10-7).Of the seven features included in the top 5% features, five were texture-related.A radiomics-based machine learning signature showed the potential to accurately differentiate GGOs due to COVID-19 pneumonia from those due to other acute lung diseases.Most of the discriminant radiomics features were texture-related.This approach may assist clinician to adopt the appropriate management early, while improving the triage of patients. While there has been significant progress in the development of rapid COVID-19 diagnostics, as the pandemic unfolds, new challenges have emerged, including whether these technologies can reliably detect the more infectious variants of concern and be viably deployed in non-clinical settings as "self-tests".Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW, a widely used rapid antigen test, included limit of detection, variant detection, test performance across different age-groups, and usability with self/caregiver-administration.While BinaxNOW detected the highly infectious variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) first identified in the UK, B.1.351 (Beta) first identified in South Africa, P.1 (Gamma) first identified in Brazil, B.1.617.2 (Delta) first identified in India and B.1.2, a non-VOC, test sensitivity decreased with decreasing viral loads.Moreover, BinaxNOW sensitivity trended lower when devices were performed by patients/caregivers themselves compared to trained clinical staff, despite universally high usability assessments following self/caregiver-administration among different age groups.Overall, these data indicate that while BinaxNOW accurately detects the new viral variants, as rapid COVID-19 tests enter the home, their already lower sensitivities compared to RT-PCR may decrease even more due to user error. COVID-19 diagnostics was quickly ramped up worldwide early 2020 based on the detection of viral RNA.However, based on the scientific knowledge for pre-existing coronaviruses, it was expected that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will be detected from symptomatic and at significant rates also from asymptomatic individuals due to persistence of non-infectious RNA.To increase the efficacy of diagnostics, surveillance, screening and pandemic control, rapid methods, such as antigen tests, are needed for decentralized testing and to assess infectiousness.A novel automated mariPOC SARS-CoV-2 test was developed for the detection of conserved structural viral nucleocapsid proteins.The test utilizes sophisticated optical laser technology for two-photon excitation and individual detection of immunoassay solid-phase particles.We validated the new method against qRT-PCR.Sensitivity of the test was 100.0% (13/13) directly from nasopharyngeal swab specimens and 84.4% (38/45) from swab specimens in undefined transport mediums.Specificity of the test was 100.0% (201/201).The tests limit of detection was 2.7 TCID50/test.It showed no cross-reactions.Our study shows that the new test can detect infectious individuals already in 20 min with clinical sensitivity close to qRT-PCR.The mariPOC is a versatile platform for syndromic testing and for high capacity infection control screening of infectious individuals. Providing sufficient testing capacities and accurate results in a time-efficient way are essential to prevent the spread and lower the curve of a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.In line with recent research investigating how simulation-based models and tools could contribute to mitigating the impact of COVID-19, a discrete event simulation model is developed to design optimal saliva-based COVID-19 testing stations performing sensitive, non-invasive, and rapid-result RT-qPCR tests processing.This model aims to determine the adequate number of machines and operators required, as well as their allocation at different workstations, according to the resources available and the rate of samples to be tested per day.The model has been built and experienced using actual data and processes implemented on-campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where an average of around 10,000 samples needed to be processed on a daily basis, representing at the end of August 2020 more than 2% of all the COVID-19 tests performed per day in the USA.It helped identify specific bottlenecks and associated areas of improvement in the process to save human resources and time.Practically, the overall approach, including the proposed modular discrete event simulation model, can easily be reused or modified to fit other contexts where local COVID-19 testing stations have to be implemented or optimized.It could notably support on-site managers and decision-makers in dimensioning testing stations by allocating the appropriate type and quantity of resources. Airborne pathogens have been considered as highly infectious and transmittable between humans.With the pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an on-site diagnostic system-integrated airborne pathogen-monitoring machine is recommended by experts for preventing and controlling the early stage -coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread.In this work, a small-volume rotating microfluidic fluorescence chip-integrated aerosol SARS-CoV-2 sampling system was constructed to satisfy the demand for rapid on-site sample collection and detection of SARS-CoV-2.The rotating microfluidic fluorescence system with small volume has very high sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (detection limit of 10 copies/L with the shortest Ct value of 15 min), which is comparable to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The precision variation coefficients within/between batches are very low [coefficient of variation (CV) % 5.0%].Our work has passed the comprehensive inspection of the microfluidic chip performance by the Shanghai Medical Device Testing Institute [National Medical Inspection (Design) no.4408] and successfully tested 115 clinical samples.The integrated system exhibits 100% specificity, high sensitivity (10 copies/L), and good precision (CV % 5.0%) in the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, thus realizing rapid monitoring and diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on-site. Most U.S. overnight youth camps did not operate during the summer of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic* (1).Several that did operate demonstrated that multiple prevention strategies, including pre- and postarrival testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, masking, and physical distancing helped prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19; in contrast, camps that relaxed prevention strategies, such as requiring a single prearrival test without subsequent testing, experienced outbreaks (2-4).The availability of COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged 12 years enabled implementation of an additional prevention strategy that was not available in summer 2020.This study assessed the number of COVID-19 cases and potential secondary spread among 7,173 staff members and campers from 50 states, 13 countries, and U.S. military overseas bases at nine independently operated U.S. summer youth camps affiliated with the same organization.The camps implemented multiple prevention strategies including vaccination, testing, podding (cohorting), masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene during June-August 2021.Vaccination coverage was 93% among eligible persons aged 12 years.All staff members (1,955) and campers (5,218) received site-specific, protocol-defined screening testing, which included prearrival testing and screening tests during the camp session (38,059 tests).Screening testing identified six confirmed COVID-19 cases (one in a staff member and five in campers) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (screening test positivity rate = 0.02%).Three additional cases (in two staff members and one camper) were identified based on symptoms and were confirmed by RT-PCR testing.Testing for SARS-CoV-2, isolation, and quarantine in a population with high vaccination coverage resulted in no known secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 identified during camp.Implementation of multicomponent strategies is critical for prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings, including overnight youth camps. We evaluated the performance of 11 SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests using a reference set of heat-inactivated samples from 278 unexposed persons and 258 COVID-19 patients, some of whom contributed serial samples.The reference set included samples with a variation in SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers, as determined by an in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA).The five evaluated rapid diagnostic tests had a specificity of 99.0% and a sensitivity that ranged from 56.3 to 81.6% and decreased with low IFA IgG titers.The specificity was > 99% for five out of six platform-based tests, and when assessed using samples collected 22 days after symptom onset, two assays had a sensitivity of > 96%.These two assays also detected samples with low IFA titers more frequently than the other assays.In conclusion, the evaluated antibody tests showed a heterogeneity in their performances and only a few tests performed well with samples having low IFA IgG titers, an important aspect for diagnostics and epidemiological investigations. As one of the major approaches in combating the COVID-19 pandemics, the availability of specific and reliable assays for the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and its proteins is essential to identify the infection in suspected populations, make diagnoses in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, and determine clearance of the virus after the infection.For these purposes, use of the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for detection of the viral nucleic acid remains the most valuable in terms of its specificity, fast turn-around, high-throughput capacity, and reliability.It is critical to update the sequences of primers and probes to ensure the detection of newly emerged variants.Various assays for increased levels of IgG or IgM antibodies are available for detecting ongoing or past infection, vaccination responses, and persistence and for identifying high titers of neutralizing antibodies in recovered individuals.Viral genome sequencing is increasingly used for tracing infectious sources, monitoring mutations, and subtype classification and is less valuable in diagnosis because of its capacity and high cost.Nanopore target sequencing with portable options is available for a quick process for sequencing data.Emerging CRISPR-Cas-based assays, such as SHERLOCK and AIOD-CRISPR, for viral genome detection may offer options for prompt and point-of-care detection.Moreover, aptamer-based probes may be multifaceted for developing portable and high-throughput assays with fluorescent or chemiluminescent probes for viral proteins.In conclusion, assays are available for viral genome and protein detection, and the selection of specific assays depends on the purposes of prevention, diagnosis and pandemic control, or monitoring of vaccination efficacy. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undoubtedly created an emerging disease of topmost public health priority spilling throughout the globe.The diagnosis currently relies on a multiplex of criteria including the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and in vitro diagnostics.Presently, the real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) is considered as the most reliable assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and is being supplemented by other auxiliary tests, including serology and radiology.Many of these molecular and immunological tests have been validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and commercial kits have been introduced in the field.But, considering the sensitivity and specificity based shortcomings and the lacunae in monitoring the spread of the virus, there is an immense need to develop integrated smart devices based on novel, safe, rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques and implement them on a large scale to curb this outbreak in the country and the world as a whole.Keywords: clinical manifestations; COVID-19; diagnosis; PCR; SARS-COV-2; serology. Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis.Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive.These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries.Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7.A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8.Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection.Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing.We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred.We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11).We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example.With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor.At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence.Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa.The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing.Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases.In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection.However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results.LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications.Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection.The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 L capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 C for 10 min.At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection.Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay.The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with thrombotic complications in adults, but the incidence of COVID-19-related thrombosis in children and adolescents is unclear.Most children with acute COVID-19 have mild disease, but coagulopathy has been associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a postinfectious complication.We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence of thrombosis in children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C and evaluate associated risk factors.We classified patients into 1 of 3 groups for analysis: COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2.Among a total of 853 admissions (COVID-19, n = 426; MIS-C, n = 138; and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2, n = 289) in 814 patients, there were 20 patients with thrombotic events (TEs; including 1 stroke).Patients with MIS-C had the highest incidence (9 [6.5%] of 138) vs COVID-19 (9 [2.1%] of 426) or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (2 [0.7%] of 289).In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, a majority of TEs (89%) occurred in patients age 12 years.Patients age 12 years with MIS-C had the highest rate of thrombosis at 19% (9 of 48).Notably, 71% of TEs that were not present on admission occurred despite thromboprophylaxis.Multivariable analysis identified the following as significantly associated with thrombosis: age 12 years, cancer, presence of a central venous catheter, and MIS-C.In patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, hospital mortality was 2.3% (13 of 564), but it was 28% (5 of 18) in patients with TEs.Our findings may help inform pediatric thromboprophylaxis strategies. A term infant with persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn developed clinical and laboratory features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in childhood (MIS-C) between days 12 and 14.Mother and baby were anti-SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG positive and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM negative on day 18, with negative COVID-19 PCR on repeated testing; possible first documentation of neonatal MIS-C following passive transfer of maternal antibodies. We describe six teenagers presenting with fever and severe abdominal symptoms admitted with concerns for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, and increased D-dimers.Imaging studies revealed multifocal airspace disease and ground-glass opacities.SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction and serologies were negative.All patients reported a history of vaping, prompting E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) diagnosis.MIS-C has overlapping clinical and laboratory features highlighting the added challenge of diagnosing EVALI during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keywords COVID-19 pandemic, EVALI, MIS-C. In early 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rare cases were reported in children and adolescents of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).MIS-C is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction and usually presents late in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Since May 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded all reported cases of COVID-19 and MIS-C in children and adolescents in the USA.In April 2021, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised its clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing hyperinflammation and MIS-C.There are several challenges ahead for preventing, diagnosing, and managing MIS-C, particularly following the rapid emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2.This Editorial aims to present an update on the current status of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of MIS-C and includes some updates from population studies and clinical guidelines. In The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Zhu et al.1 report that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) targets IL-1+ neutrophils to exert anti-inflammatory effects in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a post-infectious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19. Initially, the global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spared children from severe disease.However, after the initial wave of infections, clusters of a novel hyperinflammatory disease have been reported in regions with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.While the characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains unknown.Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases.We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal isotype-switching and neutralization capability.We further profiled the secreted immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, CCL28).Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues.Markers of activated myeloid function were also evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses.Finally, to assess the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens.All patients were treated with anti- IL6R antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization of inflammatory markers. Myocarditis has a wide array of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death.Pediatric myocarditis is a rare disease, with an estimated annual incidence of 1 to 2 per 100,000 children though its true prevalence remains unknown due to its variable and often subclinical presentation.The diagnosis of myocarditis is challenging in the era of COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can have overlapping clinical conundrum.Here, we present a case of a 17-year-old male presenting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, and electrocardiogram (EKG) findings concerning for myocardial injury along with elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate), and CRP (C-Reactive Protein).We discuss the key elements of our clinical experience with this case and review the literature for pediatric myocarditis, with a focus on differentiating it from MIS-C in the current COVID-19 pandemic era. A significant surge in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C, also called Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - PIMS) has been observed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.MIS-C shares many clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), although clinical course and outcomes are divergent.We analyzed whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues from these patients using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures, i.e., the 166-gene viral pandemic (ViP) signature, and its 20-gene severe (s)ViP subset that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a 13-transcript signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD.Our analyses revealed that KD and MIS-C are on the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19.While both the pediatric syndromes converge upon an IL15/IL15RA -centric cytokine storm, suggestive of shared proximal pathways of immunopathogenesis, they diverge in other laboratory parameters and cardiac phenotypes.The ViP signatures also revealed unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity. Recent studies on the pathogenesis and clinical spectrum of human disease following infection with the new human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, have identified the varied presentations and sequelae of COVID-19.Acute cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 results in multiorgan damage due to vascular hyperpermeability, edema, and hypercoagulation.The long-term consequences of infection from SARS-CoV-2 include long COVID.or post-COVID syndrome, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Several case reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) have shown the presentation at more than four weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in adults more than 21 years of age.In September 2021, a published systematic review of the literature identified 221 patients with MIS-A, representing the most comprehensive clinical study to date.MIS-A occurs in the post-acute COVID-19 period.The pathogenesis may involve a dysregulated antibody-mediated immune response, similar to MIS-C.Therefore, patients with MIS-A may respond to supportive therapies that control hyperinflammation.This Editorial aims to describe MIS-A and discuss COVID-19 as a spectrum of hyperinflammatory disease in terms of severity, extent, duration, and patient age. Children are infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as often as adults, but with fewer symptoms.During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C), with symptoms similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was described in young minors testing positive for COVID-19.The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined MIS-C as occurring in <21-year-olds, triggering hundreds of PubMed-listed papers.However, postpubertal adolescents are no longer children biologically; the term MIS-C is misleading.Furthermore, MIS also occurs in adults, termed MIS-A by the CDC.Acute and delayed inflammations can be triggered by COVID-19.The 18th birthday is an administrative not a biological age limit, whereas the body matures slowly during puberty.This blur in defining children leads to confusion regarding MIS-C/MIS-A.United States and European Union (EU) drug approval is handled separately for children, defined as <18-year-olds, ascribing non-existent physical characteristics up to the 18th birthday.This blur between the administrative and the physiological meanings for the term child is causing flawed demands for pediatric studies in all drugs and vaccines, including those against COVID-19.Effective treatment of all conditions, including COVID-19, should be based on actual physiological need.Now, the flawed definition for children in the development of drugs and vaccines and their approval is negatively impacting prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in minors.This review reveals the necessity for redefining pediatric age groups to rapidly establish recommendations for optimal prevention and treatment in minors. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) is a post-infectious complication described in children and adolescents with previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.Because of its potential to evolve to severe disease -including cardiovascular impairment and multiple organ failure it requires a prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, including intensive care for most cases.These guidelines compile recent information from scientific literature, from our local clinical experiences during the past pandemic year, and have been discussed by experts.The recommendations provided are meant to help the clinical work of health teams attending the pediatric population. BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has recently been described in children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).This report describes 2 children with MIS-C who were initially diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome but who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. CASE REPORT Case 1.A 7-year-old boy with fever, cough, and dyspnea was treated with oxygen, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, and methylprednisolone and showed a worsening of clinical conditions, persistent fever, hypotension, and hematological parameters compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).Three intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day) were followed by a progressive resolution.Case 2.A 14-year-old girl with syncope, fever, diarrhea, oliguria, and increased creatinine levels required fluid infusion and correction of electrolyte imbalance.The increase of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, troponin, and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) was associated with grade I atrioventricular block and pericardial effusion.The patient showed myositis and severe muscular weakness, with hematological parameters compatible with MIS-C. She started IVIG and 3 intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone.However, bradycardia, tachypnea, severe hypotension, loss of consciousness, oliguria, bilateral ground-glass pneumonia, bilateral pleural, and peritoneal effusion, in the absence of thromboembolism, required treatment with furosemide, albumin, and enoxaparin, and was followed by a prompt resolution.CONCLUSIONS These 2 pediatric cases highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in all patients with acute symptoms and signs of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, cases of MIS-C can become more prevalent, and pediatricians should be aware of diagnostic and management guidelines. Children and adolescents infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are predominantly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms compared with the more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) described in adults.However, SARS-CoV-2 is also associated with a widely reported but poorly understood paediatric systemic vasculitis.This multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has features that overlap with myocarditis, toxic-shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease.Current evidence indicates that MIS-C is the result of an exaggerated innate and adaptive immune response, characterized by a cytokine storm, and that it is triggered by prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure.Epidemiological, clinical and immunological differences classify MIS-C as being distinct from Kawasaki disease.Differences include the age range, and the geographical and ethnic distribution of patients.MIS-C is associated with prominent gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system involvement, admission to intensive care unit, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, high levels of IFN and low counts of naive CD4+ T cells, with a high proportion of activated memory T cells.Further investigation of MIS-C will continue to enhance our understanding of similar conditions associated with a cytokine storm. BACKGROUND Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, children who were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) with vascular inflammation were described as having a vasculitis similar to Kawasakis disease.There are now consensus clinical guidelines that have described the presentation and diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.This report aims to describe a case of MIS-C in an 11-year-old Saudi Arabian girl who presented with coronary artery aneurysm and cardiac involvement.CASE REPORT We describe an 11-year-old Saudi girl who was asymptomatic for 3 weeks after contracting SARS-CoV-2.Three weeks after suffering a mild flulike illness, she developed a high fever, cough, and severe clinical deterioration within 12 h of admission, including shock, rash, pleural effusion, high inflammatory markers, and a coronary aneurysm.As per current practice, the diagnosis was confirmed as multisystem inflammatory syndrome based on a SARS-CoV-2 test with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 2 nasopharyngeal aspirates.Her condition was successfully treated with antibiotics, inotropes, IVIG, aspirin, and Tocilizumab, in addition to high-flow oxygen therapy.Eventually, she was able to return home after fully recovering.CONCLUSIONS The findings in this report suggest that children with MIS-C due to SARS-CoV-2 infection can have a good prognosis, even when they suffer from coronary artery and cardiac involvement.The increasing number of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that affect children supports the importance of RT-PCR for the COVID-19 diagnostic test for children with multisystem or cardiovascular inflammation, which may guide the most appropriate clinical management of the variants of MIS-C. As of May 2020, an emerging immune-mediated syndrome mainly affecting children has been detected primarily in Europe and the United States.The incidence of this syndrome appears to mirror the initial infectious assault, with a delay of several weeks.This syndrome has been termed "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children" (MIS-C) and is observed in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The phenotypes of presentation include several characteristic features, including prolonged fever, skin eruption, neck stiffness, and gastrointestinal manifestations with pronounced abdominal pain.Shock and organ dysfunction on presentation are frequent but inconsistent, whereas respiratory distress is typically and notably absent.We have reviewed recently published data aiming to better understand MIS-C, with a focus on its mucocutaneous manifestations. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) affects a small percentage of pediatric patients infected with COVID-19 and is characterized by fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, multisystem involvement, and severe illness necessitating hospitalization.Skin findings are often present in these patients, and when initially compared with Kawasaki disease, they likely represent distinct phenomena and overall remain poorly characterized.In this retrospective review of 34 case reports and series, we identified cutaneous manifestations documented in 417 of 736 patients (57%) with MIS-C associated with COVID-19."Rash" was the sole descriptor of skin findings in nearly half of patients.Case reports and smaller case series provided more detail, outlining a broad range of lesion morphologies (polymorphic, maculopapular, morbilliform, erythrodermic, urticarial, reticular, petechial, purpuric) in variable anatomic distribution.More thorough descriptions of dermatologic manifestations in patients with MIS-C are warranted to better characterize this syndrome, as they may lend important insight into pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown cause affecting children under 5 years of age.It is thought to be triggered by several viruses.Recently, Kawasaki-like disease has been reported worldwide in patients with COVID-19, giving rise to a new term of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We report a case of a previously healthy 7-year boy, referred to our hospital with provisional diagnosis of measles due to generalised erythematous, maculopapular rash and conjunctivitis.On detailed evaluation, the patient fulfilled the clinical and laboratory criteria of MIS-C, and COVID-19 antibodies were positive.He was treated successfully with high dose of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and methylprednisolone.Patient was followed one week later with repeat echocardiography, which showed improvement.In conclusion, early recognition and timely treatment can prevent adverse outcomes in MIS-C. Key Words: COVID-19, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age.While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasakis disease.Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease.There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs.Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children.Here, we define immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen receptor repertoire analysis, unbiased serum proteomics, and in vitro assays.Despite no evidence of active infection, we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways including cytokines, complement/coagulation, and fluid shear stress in MIS-C patients.Moreover, NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated, and plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded.Consistently, we detect elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture.Thus, we define immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children. As the world came to terms with the current COVID-19 pandemic, children were initially thought to have milder disease than adults with significantly lower morbidity and mortality.The emergence of a multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first recognized in Europe, and then across centers in the United States.Early and widespread data sharing among centers across the world was extremely helpful in early identification and treatment of these children, with a good prognosis in a majority of cases.Significant research is required to answer several questions that have been raised, including susceptibility, long-term effects, and pathogenesis and treatment options to name a few. Les rpercussions de la maladie au coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) sur la morbidit et la mortalit chez les enfants se sont rvles relativement faibles.Si un enfant se prsente ma clinique avec une fivre persistante et une hyperinflammation systmique sans aucune exposition connue la COVID-19, quelle est la probabilit quil soit atteint du syndrome inflammatoire multisystmique de lenfant (MIS-C)?Que sait-on actuellement du MIS-C et quel est le pronostic pour les enfants qui en souffrent?RPONSE: En plein cur de la pandmie de la COVID-19, lmergence dun nouveau problme prsente encore une fois un dfi additionnel aux cliniciens, aux professionnels de la sant publique et la population pdiatrique.Le syndrome inflammatoire multisystmique chez les enfants est rare, mais potentiellement grave, et il a t observ chez des enfants dont la maladie la COVID-19 a t confirme environ 2 6 semaines avant lapparition des symptmes.Au nombre des signes et des symptmes courants figurent une fivre persistante, une hyperinflammation systmique, des malaises gastro-intestinaux (p. ex.douleurs abdominales, vomissements, diarrhe), des changements mucocutans (p. ex.ruptions cutanes, conjonctivite), une cphale ou une dysfonction cardiaque.tant donn que de nombreux enfants sont asymptomatiques ou ne prsentent que des symptmes lgers de la COVID-19, le dveloppement du MIS-C peut sembler soudain et surprenant aux familles et aux mdecins.Mme si les enfants atteints du MIS-C ncessitent habituellement une hospitalisation, les issues sont largement favorables grce une reconnaissance rapide du syndrome et une thrapie intense. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious, sometimes life-threatening late complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with multiorgan involvement and evidence of immune activation.The pathogenesis of MIS-C is not known, nor is the pathogenesis of the severe organ damage that is the hallmark of MIS-C. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), the virus responsible for roseola, is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that causes close to universal infection by the age of 3 years.HHV-6 remains latent for life and can be activated during inflammatory states, by other viruses, and by host cell apoptosis.HHV-6 has been associated with end-organ diseases, including hepatitis, carditis, and encephalitis.In addition, 1% of people have inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (iciHHV-6), which is HHV-6 that has been integrated into chromosomal telomeric regions and is transmitted through the germ line.iciHHV-6 can be reactivated and has been associated with altered immune responses.We report here a case of MIS-C in which an initial high HHV-6 DNA polymerase chain reaction viral load assay prompted testing for iciHHV-6, which yielded a positive result.Additional research may be warranted to determine if iciHHV-6 is commonly observed in patients with MIS-C and, if so, whether it may play a part in MIS-C pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus of the coronavirus family responsible for a global pandemic since December 2019.More than 35 million people have been affected with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with more than one million deaths worldwide.Michigan was one of the top three states in the United States that was severely affected by the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic with more than 7000 deaths in adults and greater than 145,000 confirmed infections.However, compared to adults, the majority of children until recently were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness with SARS-CoV-2.Recently, a rare but potentially serious presentation associated with SARS-CoV-2 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been recently reported and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a case definition for the same.We report the clinical and laboratory presentations and outcomes of 34 children with MIS-C who were evaluated within a 12 week period at a pediatric emergency department (PED) of single institution in Michigan.These cases presented approximately three weeks after the peak of adult SAR-CoV-2 related deaths occurred in the state.While many children presented with clinical characteristics similar to incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD), they also exhibited certain unique features which differentiated MIS-C from KD.The information presented below will aid clinicians with early recognition, evaluation and management of MIS-C in the emergency department. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but deadly new disease in children that rapidly progresses to hyperinflammation and shock, and can lead to multiple organ failure if unrecognized.It has been found to be temporally associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and is often associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure in children.In this issue of the JCI, Porritt, Paschold, et al.identify restricted T cell receptor (TCR) -chain variable domain (V) usage in patients with severe MIS-C, indicating a potential role for SARS-CoV-2 as a superantigen.These findings suggest that a blood test that determines the presence of specific TCR variable gene (TRBV) segments may identify patients at risk for severe MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection is well known.We describe a 12-year-old child developing MIS-C after receiving 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines without clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection.A possible association between the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and MIS-C cannot be excluded. Most of the reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children reported mild-to-moderate disease manifestations.However, recent reports explored a rare pediatric multisystem syndrome possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).The study prospectively enrolled 5 patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.They were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).Their clinical presentation, laboratory, and outcome were described.All patients shared similar clinical presentations such as persistent documented fever for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal involvement, and increased inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, and ferritin).Three patients had concurrent positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and the other 2 patients had contact with suspected COVID-19 positive patients.They were all managed in the PICU and received intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroid, and hydroxychloroquine.The hospital stays ranged between 3 and 21 days.One patient died due to severe multiorgan failures and shock, and the other 4 patients were discharged with good conditions.Pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for MIS-C. MIS-C has a spectrum of clinical and laboratory presentations, and the clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and should initiate its early treatment to avoid unfavorable outcomes.Long-term follow-up studies will be required to explore any sequelae of MIS-C, precisely the cardiovascular complications. The pathophysiology of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C) is unknown.It occurs several weeks after COVID-19 infection or exposure; however, MIS is rarely reported after COVID-19 vaccination, and cases are mostly in adults.Herein, we present a 12-year-old male who had no prior COVID-19 infection or exposure and developed MIS-C after his first dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. In April 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe, a cluster of children with hyperinflammatory shock with features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome was reported in England* (1).The patients signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2-4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1).The clinical signs and symptoms present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1).On May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case definition, and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases to local and state health departments.As of July 29, a total of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to CDC.A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results.The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2-4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease.Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults has been associated with thrombosis.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with COVID-19 case series have reported high fibrinogen levels, but it is not known whether this causes thrombophilia.We report two patients needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) who both suffered thrombotic complications.We retrospectively reviewed patients with MIS-C needing ECMO support admitted to a single Paediatric and Cardiac Intensive Care Unit within a regional center for MIS-C in South East England.Two children required ECMO for cardiovascular support.Both developed thrombotic events despite receiving heparin infusions at dosing higher than the interquartile range for our ECMO population.Case 1 developed a right anterior and middle cerebral artery infarct, which led to his death.Case 2 had a right atrial thrombus, which resolved without complication.When compared with patients undergoing ECMO in the same institution in pre-MIS-C era, fibrinogen levels were consistently higher before and during ECMO therapy.MIS-C patients presenting with hyperfibrinogenemia are likely to have a propensity toward thrombotic complications; this must be considered when optimizing the anticoagulation strategy on ECMO. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, MIS-A, is a rare but severe post-covid-19 immunologic complication.The presentation is similar to Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C.Both MIS-A/C are life-threatening immunologic syndromes characterized by hypotension, skin rashes, myocardial affection, coagulopathy and GI symptoms.Here we describe a case of MIS-A in a 35-year-old previously healthy female who, five weeks after a mild covid-19 infection, presented with a life-threatening immunological reaction.The patient made a swift recovery upon treatment with immunoglobulins, corticosteroids and an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.We want to highlight the importance of immunological derangements following covid-19 infections in adults.We also present a treatment suggestion for MIS-A based on the management routine for MIS-C, which has been developed from international discussions and collaborations by pediatric rheumatologists in Sweden and around the world. In the early stages of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it was assumed that this infection is very mild and uncommon in children.However, recent reports have shown that children may also develop the disease and its severe complications.These complications included shock, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and pneumonia in children.A previously healthy 14-month-old boy presented with fever, irritability, and skin rash, besides changes in the lips, conjunctiva, and tongue.His medical history, clinical presentations, treatment, laboratory data, and follow-up information were recorded.He was treated according to the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD).He had a history of close contact with a COVID-19 patient.However, the result of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19 was negative.Immunoglobulin M for COVID-19 was positive (1.20), while immunoglobulin G was negative (0.37).Three weeks later, seroconversion of COVID-19 immunoglobulin G (1.42) occurred.Despite treatment with two doses of intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, coronary artery ectasia was detected.On the sixth day of hospitalization, the patient experienced hypotension, which necessitated treatment with inotropic drugs and resulted in a change of diagnosis to MIS-C.The later echocardiography showed evidence of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA), which finally changed to giant CAA.Although the patient was treated with infliximab, the size of CAA showed a significant decrease in the one-month follow-up.This is the first report of MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, accompanied by KD, which was complicated with giant CAA. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), also known as COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe resulting in a worldwide pandemic.This disease has such varying presentation within the population.Although rare, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a potentially fatal complication of SARS-CoV2 infection and can be easily missed in the early stages.Because emergency department (ED) providers are often the initial treating providers, knowledge of the clinical manifestations and treatment of MIS-C is essential.The purpose of this article is to present a case of MIS-C in a rural ED, describe the subtle signs of disease, and educate clinicians on this rare and potentially deadly disease. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still striking the global population affecting all age groups.So far, many clinical features associated with COVID-19 illness remain under-identified, especially atypical manifestations.It is essential to characterize associated rare symptoms to better recognize complications.As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) in severe infection manifesting as a generalized inflammatory reaction and immune response in many body systems, potential involvement of the male urogenital tract by SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.Herein, we report a case of a pediatric patient with orchiepididymitis associated with COVID-19 infection, emphasizing the importance of considering other manifestations such as genital involvement of MIS-C in children with COVID-19 and highlighting the need to monitor the genitourinary function after infection.Therefore, andrological consultation is necessary to evaluate fertility as a long-term follow-up, especially as the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function are still to be thoroughly researched. Although data on the incidence and severity of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection showed more significant disease among adults and the elderly, a clinical manifestation characterized by a multisystem inflammatory syndrome was described in children (MIS-C).It was initially thought to be specific to children, but recent reports have shown that it can also occur in adults.MIS-C is characterized by a number of multisystemic manifestations resembling other known previously described illnesses, mainly Kawasaki disease, especially in cases with shock, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.Available literature shows that our knowledge of MIS-C is largely incomplete.Its development in strict relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection seems documented and, in most cases, can be considered a post-infectious manifestation secondary to an abnormal immune response for some aspects, similar to that seen in adults several days after SARS-CoV-2 infection.However, in a minority of cases, a clinical picture with symptoms fulfilling criteria for MIS-C diagnosis develops during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.It is highly likely that the criteria currently used to diagnose MIS-C are too broad, meaning that children with different diseases are included.As clarity on the pathogenesis of MIS-C is lacking, different therapeutic approaches have been used, but no specific therapy is currently available.Further studies are urgently needed to improve our definition of MIS-C, to define the real impact on child health, and to elucidate the best clinical and therapeutic approach and true prognosis. Following emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a surge in the life-threatening illness now termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has raised questions about the unique effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents.Two important new studies by Consiglio et al.and Gruber et al.have begun to shine light on the immune drivers of this enigmatic disease. Childhood cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the rise as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe.Most children acquire infection from an adult household member.Children may stay asymptomatic, have a pre-symptomatic stage, or present with symptoms (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing being the most common).Nearly one-third of the pediatric cases (32%) in the United States occurred in children age 15 to 17 years.Children are also at risk of a postinfectious hyperinflammatory syndrome called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).The risk of vertical transmission is low (2%) in newborns of mothers with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the gold standard for (SARS-CoV-2).Serology should be considered in a child with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when NAAT is negative and at least 2 weeks have passed since symptom onset and for assessment of MIS-C. Easy fatigability after COVID-19 infection is reported in adults; however, data in children are lacking.Implementation of early and robust containment strategies coupled with universal COVID-19 vaccination are vital to halt the spread.[Pediatr Ann.2021;50(2):e84-e89.]. The varied spectrum of presentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is intriguing.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection.A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A).With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19.However, it is not as uncommon as we think.Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity.Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A.Also, there is no clear treatment guideline for MIS-A unlike MIS-C where the treatment protocol is well laid out.Awareness about MIS-A among treating clinicians can thus help in further evaluation and increased identification of the syndrome at the early stages thereby helping in the early institution of treatment.Our tertiary COVID care hospital in South India which has handled about 5200 cases of COVID-19 is been able to identify 04 cases of MIS-A proving that this clinical entity is not as rare as it is thought but lacks reporting and prompt identification.Here we describe 04 cases of MIS-A and strive to bring in the various aspects of it, including the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, diagnostic criteria and treatment considerations in this post second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.It included all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)/ Kawasaki disease (KD) like illness, admitted from March to September, 2020 to The Childrens Hospital, Lahore.Out of 66 children, 45 (68.2%) were COVID-19 and 21 (31.8%) MIS-C/KD temporally associated with SARS-C0V-2.The mean age was 7.9 4.2 years.Majority of children had mild to moderate illness 38 (57.6%), while 23 (34.8%) had severe or critical disease.Among all patients, 24 (36.4%) had some underlying comorbidity.Blood group A was significantly associated with severe and critical disease (p=0.030).COVID-19 in children had generally a good outcome, but children with blood group A were more susceptible to severe/critical disease.Key Words: Coronavirus disease 2019, ABO blood groups, Children, Severity, Outcome. In April 2020, data began emerging on Kawasaki-like syndrome and hyperinflammatory response in children with COVID-19.Since then, much has been published on the presentation of COVID-19 in pediatric patients, including its association with Kawasaki disease and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).However, questions still remain regarding the risk factors, pathogenesis, prognosis, and specific therapy for these manifestations of COVID-19. The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.It included all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and post-COVID multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)/ Kawasaki disease (KD) like illness, admitted from March to September, 2020 to The Childrens Hospital, Lahore.Out of 66 children, 45 (68.2%) were COVID-19 and 21 (31.8%) MIS-C/KD temporally associated with SARS-C0V-2.The mean age was 7.9 4.2 years.Majority of children had mild to moderate illness 38 (57.6%), while 23 (34.8%) had severe or critical disease.Among all patients, 24 (36.4%) had some underlying comorbidity.Blood group A was significantly associated with severe and critical disease (p=0.030).COVID-19 in children had generally a good outcome, but children with blood group A were more susceptible to severe/critical disease.Key Words: Coronavirus disease 2019, ABO blood groups, Children, Severity, Outcome. Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults.A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death.The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood.We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission.A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication.Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation.Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct from one another and implicate CD8+ T cells in the clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C. COVID-19 is to date a global pandemic that can affect all age groups; gastrointestinal symptoms are quite common in patients with COVID-19 and a new clinical entity defined as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has been described in children and adolescents previously affected by COVID-19.Presenting symptoms of this new disease include high fever and severe abdominal pain that can mimic more common causes of abdominal pain; patients can rapidly deteriorate presenting severe cardiac dysfunction and multiorgan failure.Some fatalities due to this serious illness have been reported.We describe the case of a ten-year-old patient presenting with persistent high fever associated with continuous and worsening abdominal pain.Various hypotheses were performed during his diagnostic workup and an initial appendectomy was performed in the suspect of acute appendicitis.As his clinical picture deteriorated, the child was subsequently diagnosed and successfully treated as a case of MIS-C.The objective of this case report and brief review of abdominal pain in children throughout the age groups is to provide the emergency pediatrician with updated suggestions in diagnosing abdominal pain in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives.Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease.However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions.Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response.Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C.Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality.It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems.Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD. We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients.We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site.The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8.The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site. Several cases of a severe multi-system inflammatory syndrome have been reported in children during the current COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical manifestations may resemble Kawasaki disease (KD) which is the most common childhood vasculitis.A 7-year-old-girl presented with fever, rash and abdominal pain.Examination showed maculopapular rash over lower limbs, back, right ear, trunk and abdomen; erythema and swelling over bilateral upper eyelids; conjunctival injection; reddened lips and erythema over palms and soles.She had lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), pro-brain natriuretic peptide and interleukin-6 (IL-6).Real-time polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative.Serology, however, could not be performed due to unavailability.Macrophage activation syndrome was ruled out with normal ferritin and triglyceride with raised fibrinogen level.Echocardiography showed normal coronary diameters.Child received meropenem, intravenous immunoglobulin, aspirin and methylprednisolone.She improved with resolution of fever, decrease in CRP, increase in platelet and lymphocyte count.Index child had features similar to those reported from UK and Italy: features of KD, abdominal pain, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated IL-6 and myocardial dysfunction with no significant respiratory involvement.Pediatricians should be aware of such uncommon presentation in children to initiate early treatment with immunomodulatory therapy. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized.Here, we show that pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) possess higher SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers compared to those with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), likely reflecting a longer time since onset of infection in MIS-C patients. In rare instances, pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a novel immunodysregulation syndrome termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We compared MIS-C immunopathology with severe COVID-19 in adults.MIS-C does not result in pneumocyte damage but is associated with vascular endotheliitis and gastrointestinal epithelial injury.In MIS-C, the cytokine release syndrome is characterized by IFN and not type I interferon.Persistence of patrolling monocytes differentiates MIS-C from severe COVID-19, which is dominated by HLA-DRlo classical monocytes.IFN levels correlate with granzyme B production in CD16+ NK cells and TIM3 expression on CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells.Single-cell TCR profiling reveals a skewed TCR repertoire enriched for TRBV11-2 and a superantigenic signature in TIM3+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells.Using NicheNet, we confirm IFN as a central cytokine in the communication between TIM3+/CD38+/HLA-DR+ T cells, CD16+ NK cells, and patrolling monocytes.Normalization of IFN, loss of TIM3, quiescence of CD16+ NK cells, and contraction of patrolling monocytes upon clinical resolution highlight their potential role in MIS-C immunopathogenesis. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in April 2020 in communities with high COVID-19 rates.This new condition is heterogenous but resembles Kawasaki disease (KD), a well-known but poorly understood and clinically heterogenous pediatric inflammatory condition for which weak associations have been found with a myriad of viral illnesses.Epidemiological data clearly indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is the trigger for MIS-C, which typically occurs about 1 mo after infection.These findings support the hypothesis of viral triggers for the various forms of classic KD.We further suggest that rare inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) altering the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie the pathogenesis of MIS-C in some children.The discovery of monogenic IEIs underlying MIS-C would shed light on its pathogenesis, paving the way for a new genetic approach to classic KD, revisited as a heterogeneous collection of IEIs to viruses. Most children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have mild or minimal disease, with a small proportion developing severe disease or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults but has not been studied in the pediatric population.We hypothesized that complement activation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and sought to understand if TMA was present in these patients.We enrolled 50 hospitalized pediatric patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 21, minimal coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]; n = 11, severe COVID-19) or MIS-C (n = 18).As a biomarker of complement activation and TMA, soluble C5b9 (sC5b9, normal 247 ng/mL) was measured in plasma, and elevations were found in patients with minimal disease (median, 392 ng/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 244-622 ng/mL), severe disease (median, 646 ng/mL; IQR, 203-728 ng/mL), and MIS-C (median, 630 ng/mL; IQR, 359-932 ng/mL) compared with 26 healthy control subjects (median, 57 ng/mL; IQR, 9-163 ng/mL; P < .001).Higher sC5b9 levels were associated with higher serum creatinine (P = .01) but not age.Of the 19 patients for whom complete clinical criteria were available, 17 (89%) met criteria for TMA.A high proportion of tested children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had evidence of complement activation and met clinical and diagnostic criteria for TMA.Future studies are needed to determine if hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 should be screened for TMA, if TMA-directed management is helpful, and if there are any short- or long-term clinical consequences of complement activation and endothelial damage in children with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a delayed and severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that strikes previously healthy children.As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions.We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases.We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-, IFN, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes.We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the V21.3 T cell receptor chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected.The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution.V21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro.Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles.Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal V21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health of children worldwide.Although overall mortality from COVID-19 in children remains low, an associated multisystem inflammatory disorder has emerged.The disorder has been recognized and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This comprehensive review describes the epidemiology, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, other potential diagnoses, and treatments relevant to MIS-C.The review also includes patient and family education and anticipatory guidance, and discusses nursing implications for nurses working in various roles and settings, including direct care, research, and public health. During 2020, increasing numbers of case reports, case series, and small observational studies reported long-term complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who had recovered from acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Long COVID has a prevalence of between 10-30% in patients with a recent history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Pulmonary, hematologic, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, renal, endocrine, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary, and dermatologic involvement, and chronic multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) highlights the requirement for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with long COVID.This Editorial aims to present the current status of long COVID, or post-COVID syndrome, and its global impact on health and the provision of health care. Enteritis as the only manifestation of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adolescents without features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or a prior history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been described.We report two adolescent patients (a 14-year-old male and a 20-year-old pregnant female) presenting to tertiary-care centers in the United States with severe enteritis as the only manifestation of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.The patients were hospitalized with acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with no evidence of MIS-C, and were previously healthy with no history of IBD.The patients nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and testing for other infectious etiologies was negative.Both patients received intravenous corticosteroids and recovered without short-term complications.None of the patients died.This report highlights the need for keeping a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents presenting solely with gastrointestinal manifestations, in the absence of respiratory symptoms or multisystem involvement, for prompt recognition and timely management. Although there is still much that is not understood, experience with previous coronavirus outbreaks and available data on COVID-19 indicate a reduced propensity to affect children.Nonetheless, serious complicationsalthough rareare being seen in pediatric patients.This review, written with the emergency medicine clinician in mind, describes the epidemiology, clinical features, and management implications for COVID-19 in pediatric patients.It includes a discussion of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, as well as other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are affecting children and families, such as poisonings, childhood immunizations, mental health, nonaccidental trauma, and neglect. Objectives To characterize the demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, in-hospital treatments, and health outcomes among children/adolescents diagnosed or hospitalized with COVID-19.Secondly, to describe health outcomes amongst children/adolescents diagnosed with previous seasonal influenza.Design International network cohort.Setting Real-world data from European primary care records (France/Germany/Spain), South Korean claims and US claims and hospital databases.Participants Diagnosed and/or hospitalized children/adolescents with COVID-19 at age <18 between January and June 2020; diagnosed with influenza in 2017-2018.Main outcome measures Baseline demographics and comorbidities, symptoms, 30-day in-hospital treatments and outcomes including hospitalization, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and death.Results A total of 55,270 children/adolescents diagnosed and 3,693 hospitalized with COVID-19 and 1,952,693 diagnosed with influenza were studied.Comorbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders, heart disease, and cancer were all more common among those hospitalized vs diagnosed with COVID-19.The most common COVID-19 symptom was fever.Dyspnea, bronchiolitis, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in COVID-19 than influenza.In-hospital treatments for COVID-19 included repurposed medications (<10%), and adjunctive therapies: systemic corticosteroids (6.8% to 37.6%), famotidine (9.0% to 28.1%), and antithrombotics such as aspirin (2.0% to 21.4%), heparin (2.2% to 18.1%), and enoxaparin (2.8% to 14.8%).Hospitalization was observed in 0.3% to 1.3% of the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort, with undetectable (N<5 per database) 30-day fatality.Thirty-day outcomes including pneumonia, ARDS, and MIS-C were more frequent in COVID-19 than influenza.Conclusions Despite negligible fatality, complications including pneumonia, ARDS and MIS-C were more frequent in children/adolescents with COVID-19 than with influenza.Dyspnea, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differential diagnosis.A wide range of medications were used for the inpatient management of pediatric COVID-19. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is recognized as a respiratory illness, which includes pulmonary consolidations, hypoxemic states, and hypercoagulopathic tendencies with a broad clinical severity.Recently, more reports have described post-infection manifestations.These include multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with more than 400 cases published since the start of the coronavirus disease pandemic.In October 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published 27 cases [1] describing the new multi-system inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A).Nine of the cases were reported directly to the CDC, 7 from published case reports and another 11 patients found in three distinct case series. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common findings in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, including vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and difficulty in feeding, although these symptoms tend to be mild.The hepato-biliary system and the pancreas may also be involved, usually with a mild elevation of transaminases and, rarely, pancreatitis.In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis.Gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary manifestations are probably related to a loss in enterocyte absorption capability and microscopic mucosal damage caused by a viral infection of intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes and other cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 receptor resulting in immune cells activation with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines.Specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplantation may pose a risk for the more severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but as adult data accumulate, paediatric data is still limited.The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence about the effect of COVID-19 on the gastrointestinal system in children, with emphasis on the emerging MIS-C and specific considerations such as patients with IBD and liver transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be one of the most common presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, later named COVID-19.The symptoms such as nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea may be recognised as either a finding of COVID-19 or prominent presentation of multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).COVID-19 may present with acute appendicitis and/or may mimic its clinical findings.Although, coexistence of acute appendicitis and COVID-19 has been well documented, it is not clear whether appendicitis is a complication of COVID-19 or coincidence in children.A 13-year-old boy who developed acute appendicitis during the clinical course of COVID-19 is presented to discuss the possibility of causal relationship between appendicitis and COVID-19 in children. Pediatric COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with fewer hospitalizations and often milder disease than in adults.A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death.The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood.We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission.A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8 T cells that correlated with use of vasoactive medication.Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation.Thus, non-MIS-C versus MIS-C SARS-CoV-2 associated illnesses are characterized by divergent immune signatures that are temporally distinct and implicate CD8 T cells in clinical presentation and trajectory of MIS-C. Clinical features of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 are nonspecific.In this retrospective cohort study of 39 patients evaluated for MIS-C, 11 had non-SARS-CoV-2 infections, 3 of whom were also diagnosed with MIS-C. Clinical features were similar in patients with MIS-C and patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections.Clinicians should consider non-SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients undergoing MIS-C evaluation. Hyponatraemia is frequently encountered in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with poor prognosis.This review aims to describe for the first time the prevalence, aetiology, prognostic value, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatraemia in children and adolescents with COVID-19, taking into account all relevant studies published in PubMed and Cochrane Library studies until 26th September 2021.Literature search did not detect any studies evaluating the prevalence and prognostic value of sodium disorders in paediatric patients with COVID-19.A broader literature review showed a high prevalence of hyponatraemia in children with bacterial pneumonia, while some studies have reported that hyponatraemia is relatively common in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).In adults with COVID-19, an inverse association between sodium and interleukin-6 levels has been found, indicating that hyponatraemia could be used as a surrogate marker for the risk of cytokine storm and may facilitate the identification of patients who could benefit from immunomodulatory agents.Studies are urgently needed to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of electrolyte abnormalities in children with COVID-19.In the meantime, clinicians are urged to consider hyponatraemia in children with COVID-19 as a potential red flag, investigate the cause and administer fluids and other therapies accordingly. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is an ongoing public health emergency, with over 4 million confirmed cases worldwide.Due to the novel nature of this coronavirus and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology, there is continued uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and management of COVID-19, especially in pediatric patients.In addition, a new febrile hyperinflammatory Kawasaki-like syndrome (also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C) has emerged in pediatric patients with temporal association to COVID-19 infection.This review article aims to provide an up-to-date review of the clinical and imaging findings of pediatric MIS-C associated with COVID-19, compared with typical acute pediatric COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on thoracic imaging findings.Supplemental material is available for this article.RSNA, 2020. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in March 2020, affecting millions of people worldwide.However, COVID-19 in pediatric patients represents 1-5% of all cases, and the risk for developing severe disease and critical illness is much lower in children with COVID-19 than in adults.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a possible complication of COVID-19, has been described as a hyperinflammatory condition with multiorgan involvement similar to that in Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome in children with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.This review presents an update on the diagnostic methods for COVID-19, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, serology tests, and imaging, and summarizes the current recommendations for the management of the disease.Particular emphasis is placed on respiratory support, which includes noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation strategies according to lung compliance and pattern of lung injury.Pharmacological treatment, including pathogen-targeted drugs and host-directed therapies, has been addressed.The diagnostic criteria and management of MIS-C are also summarized. We report a case of a 15-year-old female presenting with a serious multisystemic inflammatory illness during a surge of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases in our county.The initial clinical findings of sore throat and neck stiffness, followed by signs of sepsis, raised suspicion of Lemierre syndrome early in her hospital course.However, the presence of severe respiratory distress, multifocal pneumonia with pleural effusion on chest radiograph, acute kidney injury, and the discovery of coronary artery ectasia, pointed to the new entity "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)."Immune modulatory treatment was thus considered.However, progressive neck pain and swelling, coupled with the eventual growth of Fusobacterium necrophorum on blood culture, eventually led to the correct diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome. Since December 2019, Covid-19 has become a challenge for doctors around the world, including pediatricians.In most infected children, the disease manifests itself in a mild or is char- acterized by a subclinical course.At the same time, in some cases, a severe clinical picture of the so-called late Covid disease may develop, in the form of a multisystem syndrome and other complications.In 2020-2021 at the Academic Pediatric Clinic named after G. Zhvania of Tbilisi State Medical University, we observed 60 children with post-Covid complications and late Covid syn- drome.More than half (32 children - 53.3%) were under 5 years of age, with a predominance of boys (33 children - 55%) who had a Covid-19 infection 1.5-2 months before contacting us with a positive antibody reaction.Most of them (51 children - 85%) were healthy before the disease.Vasculopathy, immune thrombocytopenia, thalassemia minor, primary diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, coagulopathy, pneumonia-atelectasis, exacerbation of the underlying disease - arthralgia, arthritis and abnormal manifestations of sleep disturbance, general weakness and dizziness were noted.Separately, it is necessary to highlight the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in chirdren - MIS-C (8 children - 13%) proceeding with clinical signs of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous-lymphatic syndrome) with hectic temperature, polyserositis, hepatosplenomegaly, high rates of inflammation markers, a tendency to hypercoagulability.One patient had a coronary artery aneurysm.In 3 cases, the ANA and ANF titer was increased (up to 1:640) and also with nucleic, cytoplasmic and linear fibrils fluorescence, which indicates immune reactions in Covid infection, which can explain the positive effect of corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of these patients.Only 22 (36%) patients were hospitalized, the rest were observed on an outpatient basis.Based on the aforementioned, it can be concluded that even with the asymptomatic course of Covidinfection in children, complications can be observed and the syndrome of the so-called late Covid, which dictates the need for a thorough examination of these patients and observation in dynamics. The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020.This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities.In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death.SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a "cytokine storm" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications.The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days.It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding.This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum.This article gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation and laboratory tests of COVID-19 and correlating with the current understanding of the pathological basis of this disease in the paediatric population. A term infant girl with uneventful antenatal history had an erythematous rash followed by fever from day 8.She was diagnosed with late-onset sepsis and was treated accordingly.She received immunoglobulin for persistent thrombocytopenia, after which there was transient improvement.The patient was transferred to our hospital on day 25 after recurrence of fever, watery diarrhea, and a generalized maculopapular rash.On admission, she had tachycardia, tachypnoea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and generalized edema.Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was positive.Within 12 hours of admission, she developed cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema and needed invasive ventilation.Echocardiography revealed ejection fraction of 40% with mild pericardial effusion.N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 33000 g/L, D-dimer 16500 g/L, and ferritin 16000 ng/mL.Methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, and enoxaparin was started, with a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, associated with COVID-19.She developed seizures, pulmonary hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest the following day, along with acute kidney injury.She was extubated after 5 days.Steroid was stopped after 5 days because she developed hypertension and echocardiography had normalized.Five days after extubation, she again developed respiratory distress and was ventilated again for 2 days.Echocardiography revealed moderate left ventricular dysfunction, along with secondary elevation of ferritin.Methylprednisolone was restarted and continued for 5 days followed by tapering dose of oral prednisolone, on which she was finally discharged.Although mild myocarditis with COVID-19 has been reported, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in a newborn with refractory myocarditis, along with gastrointestinal and renal manifestations, is a rare entity.Dermatologic manifestation of neonatal COVID-19 is also unique. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV2) infection is a rapid evolving pandemic with multiple peaks of outbreak and substantial mortality worldwide.It has been proposed that infants are more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection.On the other hand, children with COVID-19 have generally milder disease compared to infected adults and more often presented with gastrointestinal symptoms compared to respiratory ones.Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c) is an ominous demonstration of COVID-19 with cardiac involvement and mortality rate <2%.From cardiovascular point of view, wide spectrum of manifestations including subclinical myocardial injury, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary thromboembolism and thrombus formation in cardiac chambers and vascular bed has been reported in COVID-19 disease.Congenital heart disease (CHD), assumed as the most prevalent form of congenital disease.Advances in medical and surgical treatments for CHD have led to more alive patients with underlying heart disease secondary to congenital defects.These group of pediatric patients are prone to heart failure, arrhythmia and embolic events.In this narrative review, we intended to evaluate the cardiovascular and pediatric presentations of COVID-19 as well as the manifestation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pediatric patients with CHD. The disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild and self-limiting in previously healthy children, but they may also develop severe disease.Severe COVID-19 infection is especially observed in very young children or those with underlying comorbidities.Moreover, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome that mimics the Kawasaki disease shock syndrome can develop in children that are genetically predisposed to displaying an overactive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.In this review, we describe the clinical phenotypes of mild and severe COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).We also discuss the possible immunobiological mechanisms that may be involved in the protection of children against COVID-19 and the development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Primary intracranial hypertension (PIH) is characterized by clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, elevated opening pressure, and absence of mass lesion, hydrocephalus, or meningeal enhancement on neuroimaging.Visual changes are a common presenting feature and if untreated there is risk of irreversible vision loss.There have been recent proposed changes to the criteria for PIH along with studies looking at the differences in imaging characteristics between adult and pediatric PIH.The presence of transverse sinus stenosis alone was highly sensitive and specific for pediatric PIH.The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial was an adult, multicenter study that examined the use of acetazolamide and weight loss on the course of PIH.The study confirmed many previously held beliefs including the most common presenting symptom in PIH is headache.Most patients present with bilateral papilledema with 58.2% of patients having symmetric Frisen scale grading and within one grade in 92.8%.Although diplopia is a common reported symptom, very few have evidence of cranial nerve palsy.Male gender, high-grade papilledema, and decreased visual acuity at presentation are risk factors for treatment failure.Acetazolamide use is associated with mild metabolic acidosis.During acetazolamide treatment, monitoring for hypokalemia or aplastic anemia is not recommended.Monitoring transaminases in the titration phase of treatment should be considered due to a case of transaminitis and pancreatitis with elevated lipase.Newer case reports have also seen associations of secondary intracranial hypertension with concurrent COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. With growing number of pediatric cases of COVID-19, a unique hyper-inflammatory syndrome, linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged in children referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).This Kawasaki Disease (KD)-like illness has been described across the world.This syndrome shares features of KD, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome and is associated with significantly elevated inflammatory markers.Everyday there are new data emerging improving the care of these patients.The Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (ACTION) is a collaborative network designed to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with end-stage heart failure and involves centers from across North America.The committee gathered information concerning COVID-19 anticoagulation practices at various centers and harmonized the data to formulate a set of recommendations. During June 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States.U.S. pediatric COVID-19-related hospitalizations increased during July-August 2021 following emergence of the Delta variant and peaked in September 2021.As of May 12, 2021, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccinations for persons aged 12 years, and on November 2, 2021, COVID-19 vaccinations were recommended for persons aged 5-11 years.** To date, clinical signs and symptoms, illness course, and factors contributing to hospitalizations during the period of Delta predominance have not been well described in pediatric patients.CDC partnered with six childrens hospitals to review medical record data for patients aged <18 years with COVID-19-related hospitalizations during July-August 2021.Among 915 patients identified, 713 (77.9%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 (acute COVID-19 as the primary or contributing reason for hospitalization), 177 (19.3%) had incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (asymptomatic or mild infection unrelated to the reason for hospitalization), and 25 (2.7%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19.Among the 713 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24.7% were aged <1 year, 17.1% were aged 1-4 years, 20.1% were aged 5-11 years, and 38.1% were aged 12-17 years.Approximately two thirds of patients (67.5%) had one or more underlying medical conditions, with obesity being the most common (32.4%); among patients aged 12-17 years, 61.4% had obesity.Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 15.8% had a viral coinfection (66.4% of whom had respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection).Approximately one third (33.9%) of patients aged <5 years hospitalized for COVID-19 had a viral coinfection.Among 272 vaccine-eligible (aged 12-17 years) patients hospitalized for COVID-19, one (0.4%) was fully vaccinated.*** Approximately one half (54.0%) of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 received oxygen support, 29.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 1.5% died; of those requiring respiratory support, 14.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Among pediatric patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations, many had severe illness and viral coinfections, and few vaccine-eligible patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were vaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccination for those aged 5 years and other prevention strategies to protect children and adolescents from COVID-19, particularly those with underlying medical conditions. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with age1,2.Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)3-5.Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein.Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population. During the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reports of a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been increasing in Europe and the United States (1-3).Clinical features in children have varied but predominantly include shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and interleukin-6 (1).Since June 2020, several case reports have described a similar syndrome in adults; this review describes in detail nine patients reported to CDC, seven from published case reports, and summarizes the findings in 11 patients described in three case series in peer-reviewed journals (4-6).These 27 patients had cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms without severe respiratory illness and concurrently received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody assays indicating recent infection.Reports of these patients highlight the recognition of an illness referred to here as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, and the role for antibody testing in identifying similar cases among adults.Clinicians and health departments should consider MIS-A in adults with compatible signs and symptoms.These patients might not have positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test results, and antibody testing might be needed to confirm previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.Because of the temporal association between MIS-A and SARS-CoV-2 infections, interventions that prevent COVID-19 might prevent MIS-A.Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis and long-term effects of this newly described condition. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started, children have been considered marginally involved compared to adults, with a quite significant percentage of asymptomatic carriers.Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19.We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy.The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers.Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement.Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD.Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher.We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment.We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to a severe inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm.We describe a case of severe COVID-19 infection in a recently diagnosed pediatric Crohn disease patient successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) blockade.The patient presented with 5 days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms.SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive.Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet.Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease or severe COVID-19 alone.The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF- blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19.Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension resolved.Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations.This case supports a role for blockade of TNF- in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade.The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, particularly in middle- and low-income countries.While this impact has been well-recognized in certain age groups, the effects, both direct and indirect, on the neonatal population remain largely unknown.There are placental changes associated, though the contributions to maternal and fetal illness have not been fully determined.The rate of premature delivery has increased and SARS-CoV-2 infection is proportionately higher in premature neonates, which appears to be related to premature delivery for maternal reasons rather than an increase in spontaneous preterm labor.There is much room for expansion, including long-term data on outcomes for affected babies.Though uncommon, there has been evidence of adverse events in neonates, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C).There are recommendations for reduction of viral transmission to neonates, though more research is required to determine the role of passive immunization of the fetus via maternal vaccination.There is now considerable evidence suggesting that the severe visitation restrictions implemented early in the pandemic have negatively impacted the care of the neonate and the experiences of both parents and healthcare professionals alike.Ongoing collaboration is required to determine the full impact, and guidelines for future management.IMPACT: Comprehensive review of current available evidence related to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neonates, effects on their health, impact on their quality of care and indirect influences on their clinical course, including comparisons with other age groups.Reference to current evidence for maternal experience of infection and how it impacts the fetus and then neonate.Outline of the need for ongoing research, including specific areas in which there are significant gaps in knowledge. This narrative review summarizes the main aspects underlying the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, its epidemiology, pathophysiology, pointing to differences of SARS-CoV-2 main receptors ACE2, in terms of expression and the amount of soluble ACE2 in the circulation of children, men and women, and also in those with risk factors such as the smokers and pregnant women or presenting with comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, renal and CNS pre-existing diseases).Clinical manifestations in adults and children were also described, emphasizing the particularities already seen in children, regarding signs, symptoms, viral excretion time and the involvement of all organs and systems.The COVID-19 in the pediatric population was divided into two sections: one dedicated to previously healthy children and adolescents with COVID-19, and the other to those who live with comorbidities and acquired COVID-19.A few paragraphs were reserved to the recently described severe multisystemic inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) that shares certain characteristics with Kawasaki disease.Some studies on the infection in pregnant and postpartum women, as well as neonates were shown.This review has also covered the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, passing through the imaging diagnosis made by the chest tomography revealing ground glass patching opacities, and results of non-specific exams such as the total blood with lymphopenia, the coagulation tests with increased prothrombin times, as well as marked increments of the D-dimer, troponin and proinflammatory cytokines.In the section devoted to the specific laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, the most used RT-PCR protocols were described and some studies on the serological diagnosis with IgA, IgM and IgG detection were detailed, including the use of rapid immunochromatographic assays and discussing the ideal period after the onset of symptoms to perform each type of test.In the end, the management of pediatric patients with COVID-19 based mainly on supportive measures has been briefly commented. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread relentlessly, associated with a high frequency of respiratory failure and mortality.Children experience largely asymptomatic disease, with rare reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).Identifying immune mechanisms that result in these disparate clinical phenotypes in children could provide critical insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis.Using systems serology, in this study we observed in 25 children with acute mild COVID-19 a functional phagocyte and complement-activating IgG response to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the acute responses generated in adults with mild disease.Conversely, IgA and neutrophil responses were significantly expanded in adults with severe disease.Moreover, weeks after the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children who develop MIS-C maintained highly inflammatory monocyte-activating SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, distinguishable from acute disease in children but with antibody levels similar to those in convalescent adults.Collectively, these data provide unique insights into the potential mechanisms of IgG and IgA that might underlie differential disease severity as well as unexpected complications in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. Introduction Children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), also known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), present with abdominal pain amongst other non-specific symptoms.Whilst initial imaging features of PIMS-TS have been reported, the duration of sonographic features remain unknown.Purpose To describe the abdominal ultrasound features of PIMS-TS at initial presentation and follow-up.Materials and Methods A retrospective review of children presenting with clinical features suspicious for PIMS-TS between April 2020 and June 2021 was carried out.Ultrasound features were documented and reviewed on initial presentation and follow up.Descriptive statistics were used and interobserver variability calculated.Results Of 140 children presenting with suspected PIMS-TS, 120 had confirmed PIMS-TS (median 9 years, interquartile range 7-12 years, 65 male) and 102 underwent abdominal ultrasound (US) at presentation.PIMS-TS was present as a single pathology in 109/120 (91%) and abdominal symptoms were present in 104/109 (95%).US examinations were abnormal in 86/102 (84%), with ascites being the most common abnormality in 65/102 children (64%, 95% CI: 54, 73%).Bowel wall thickening was present in 14/102 (14%, 95% CI: 7, 20%) children and mesenteric inflammation in 16/102 (16%, 95% CI: 9, 23%), all of whom presented with abdominal symptoms.Of these, the distal and terminal ileum were most involved (8/14, 57%).Abdominal symptoms decreased to 7/56 (13%) in children followed up at 6 months.Thirty-eight children had follow-up ultrasound and the presence of bowel inflammation had decreased to 3/27 (11%, 95% CI: -1, 23%) in the less than 2 months group and 0/17 (0%) in the greater than 2-month follow-up group.Conclusion 14% of children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) had abdominal ultrasound findings of bowel inflammation and 16% had mesenteric oedema.All ultrasound abnormalities resolved after 2 months. This is an updated guideline from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) for the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The great majority of COVID-19 patients (>90%) requiring ECMO have been supported using venovenous (V-V) ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups.However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing.Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19-related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented.Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval.There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients.Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard.We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of ECMO for COVID-19. There is limited understanding of the viral antibody fingerprint following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children.Herein, SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide immunoprofiling of children with mild/moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children versus hospitalized control patients revealed differential cytokine responses, IgM/IgG/IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding and avidity.Apart from spike and nucleocapsid, IgG/IgA recognized epitopes in nonstructural protein (NSP) 2, NSP3, NSP12-NSP14 and open reading frame (ORF) 3a-ORF9.Peptides representing epitopes in NSP12, ORF3a and ORF8 demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnosis.Antibody-binding kinetics with 24 SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed antibody parameters that distinguish children with mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.Antibody avidity to prefusion spike correlated with decreased illness severity and served as a clinical disease indicator.The fusion peptide and heptad repeat 2 region induced SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in rabbits.Thus, we identified SARS-CoV-2 antibody signatures in children associated with disease severity and delineate promising serodiagnostic and virus neutralization targets.These findings might guide the design of serodiagnostic assays, prognostic algorithms, therapeutics and vaccines in this important but understudied population. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has (as of Oct. 14, 2020) infected approximately 38 million people worldwide.The most feared sequelae of COVID-19 in adults are severe, often fatal, lung disease, venous thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and multiple organ system failure.Fortunately, unlike adults, most children who contract COVID-19 have a mild respiratory illness or asymptomatic.It is now evident that a small percentage of children develop a critical and novel illness with persistent fever , prominent GI symptoms , single or multi-organ dysfunction including shock and laboratory evidence of profound inflammation which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the CDC.Some of the reported cases share features with well-known inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and toxic shock syndrome.The temporal relationship of MIS-C and COVID-19 suggests a post-infectious immune dysregulation.Patients with MIS-C, especially those with cardiac dysfunction and/or shock, should preferably be managed in pediatric intensive care.We will discuss the epidemiology of MIS-C, similarities with known inflammatory syndromes in children, clinical presentation, and present management options
