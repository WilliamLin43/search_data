Endometriosis is a common debilitating gynecologic disease.Almost 10% of reproductive-age women are affected by this disease; they commonly suffer pelvic pain and/or infertility.Early diagnosis of this multifactorial disease remains difficult because its etiology is not clear and the early symptoms are nonspecific.In addition, many reproductive-age women are unwilling to undergo invasive laparoscopic surgery because of the possibility of decreasing fertility.Thus, identifying biomarkers for the early diagnosis of endometriosis a key focus of current research.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding transcripts that have length of > 200 nucleotides and lack protein-coding ability but still influence gene expression in various ways.With advances in genome-wide analysis, researchers have determined that lncRNAs play an important role in many human diseases, particularly tumors.Moreover, the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis has been continually recognized.In this review, we discuss the status of current research on dysregulated lncRNAs and their roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.We aim to stimulate new investigations toward the identification of lncRNAs as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and therapy of this long-term gynecological disease. Endometriosis is a benign chronic condition characterized by the existence of endometrial-like stroma and glandular tissue in extrauterine locations.The molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis have not been elucidated.We have studied the role of EXTL3 (exostosin-like 3) in endometriosis and found that it is expressed in endometrial tissue as well as endometriosis lesions.We have found that serum from endometriosis patients contains a factor or factors, which interact with EXTL3 resulting in strongly increased colony formation in regenerating cell culture.We also found increased anti-EXTL3 antibodies in endometriosis patients sera.EXTL3 is an N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase, performing a key step in heparan sulfate (HS) glucosaminoglycan synthesis.Many viruses replicate in regenerating epithelial cells and use HS as a receptor for cell entry.We measured antibody titres to viruses, which use HS as a receptor for cell entry, and found rarely increased titres for these viruses in endometriosis sera, whereas titres to viruses using other receptors were equally distributed in study groups.The data indicate that perturbation of HS metabolism is associated with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a pathologic condition affecting approximately 10% of women in their reproductive years.Characterized by abnormal growth of uterine endometrial tissue in other body areas, endometriosis can cause severe abdominal pain and/or infertility.Despite devastating consequences to patients quality of life, the causes of endometriosis are not fully understood and validated diagnostic markers for endometriosis have not been identified.Molecular analyses of ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues could lead to enhanced understanding of the disease.Here, we apply desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry (MS) imaging to chemically and spatially characterize the molecular profiles of 231 eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues from 89 endometriosis patients.DESI-MS imaging allowed clear visualization of endometrial glandular and stromal regions within tissue samples.Statistical models built from DESI-MS imaging data allowed classification of endometriosis lesions with overall accuracies of 89.4%, 98.4%, and 98.8% on training, validation, and test sample sets, respectively.Further, molecular markers that are significantly altered in ectopic endometrial tissues when compared to eutopic tissues were identified, including fatty acids and glycerophosphoserines.Our study showcases the value of MS imaging to investigate the molecular composition of endometriosis lesions and pinpoints metabolic markers that may provide new knowledge on disease pathogenesis. Endometriosis is a complex gynecological disorder, affecting up to 10% of women of childbearing age, characterized by the presence of functional endometrial tissue at ectopic positions generally within the peritoneum.It is a heritable condition influenced by multiple genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, with an overall heritability estimated at approximately 50%.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of rs1250248 and rs11674184 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mapping to fibronectin 1 (FN1) and growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) genetic loci, respectively, with the risk of endometriosis.A total of 166 women with endometriosis (stages I-IV) who were hospitalized for the condition, diagnosed by laparoscopic intervention and histologically confirmed, and 168 normal controls were recruited and genotyped.Genotyping of the rs1250248 and rs11674184 SNPs was performed with TaqMan primer/probe sets.A significant association was detected with the A allele, as well as the AA and AG genotypes of rs1250248 (FN1) in patients with endometriosis, as well as in patients with stage I and II of the disease only.The rs11674184 SNP of the GREB1 gene was not found to be associated with an increased susceptibility to endometriosis either for all patients (stages I-IV) or for subgroups of stage I and II or III and IV of the disease only.Our results demonstrated a genetic association between the rs1250248 (FN1) SNP and endometriosis at both the genotypic and allelic level.However, although rs11674184 of GREB1 constitutes one of the most consistently associated SNPs with endometriosis in European ancestry populations, it was not found to be associated with endometriosis in this study. Endometriosis (EMS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of extrauterine endometrial tissues.It has been previously reported that the refluxed blood containing viable endometrial tissues and the defective elimination of peritoneal macrophages in the pelvic cavity may involve in EMS pathogenesis.However, the mechanism by which macrophages exhibit attenuated phagocytic capability in EMS remains undetermined.Herein, we found that heme, the byproduct of lysed erythrocytes, accumulated abnormally in the peritoneal fluid (PF) of patients with EMS (14.22 mol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.54-16.71), compared with the EMS-free group (9.517 mol/L, 95% CI: 8.891-10.1053).This abnormal accumulation was not associated with the color of PF, phase of the menstrual cycle or severity of the disease.The reduced phagocytic ability of peritoneal macrophages (pMs) was observed in the EMS group.Consistently, a high-concentration (30 mol/L) heme treatment impaired EMS-pMs phagocytosis more than a low-concentration (10 mol/L) heme treatment.A similar phenomenon was observed in the EMS-free control pMs (Ctrl-pMs) and the CD14+ peripheral monocytes (CD14+ Mos).These results indicated that a high heme concentration exhibits a negative effect on macrophage phagocytosis, which supplements the mechanism of impaired scavenger function of pMs in EMS. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent benign gynecological disease that shares some common features of malignancy.Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as a core mechanism of endometriosis.MALAT1 is widely known as EMT promoter, while miR200 family members (miR200s) are considered as EMT inhibitors.Previous studies have reported that MALAT1 upregulation and miR200s downregulation are observed in endometriosis.MiR200c has been regarded as the strongest member of miR200s to interact with MALAT1.However, whether MALAT1/miR200c regulates EMT remains largely unclear.In this study, the roles of miR200s and MALAT1 in ectopic endometrium were investigated.Additionally, the effects of E2 on EMT and MALAT1/miR200s were examined in both EECs and Ishikawa cells.Notably, E2 could upregulate MALAT1 and downregulate miR200s expression levels and induce EMT in EECs and Ishikawa cells.PHTPP, an ER antagonist, could reverse the effect of E2.Overexpression of miR200c and knockdown of MALAT1 significantly inhibited E2-mediated EMT, suggesting that both miR200c and MALAT1 are involved in the E2-induced EMT process in endometriosis.In addition, a reciprocal inhibition was found between miR200s and MALAT1.Therefore, the role of MALAT1/miR200c in EMT is influenced by the presence of estrogen during endometriosis development. Despite advances in biomedical technology, endometriosis remains a disease that is inefficiently diagnosed and treated.American women often suffer from debilitating symptoms for a decade before being diagnosed.Addressing this deficiency is crucial if women are to live well with endometriosis.Framed by relational dialectics theory 2.0, the current study analyzes womens experiences of endometriosis diagnoses via online narrative postings.Results reveal two centripetal (dominant) discourses: (a) the discourse of psycho-abnormality, and (b) the discourse of biological normality.Narrators invocation of the discourse of psycho-abnormality disqualifies womens suffering as imagined and "all in their heads," whereas invocation of the discourse of biological normality naturalizes womens suffering as "just part of being a woman."The discourse of psycho-abnormality and the discourse of biological normality, both rooted in patriarchal influences, hinder diagnosis and subsequently treatment and rehabilitation of endometriosis.Encouragingly, a third (though marginalized) discourse emerged: the discourse of reclaiming expertise.Narrators invocation of this discourse directly opposes the discourses of psycho-abnormality and biological normality by inciting validation of embodied knowledge in medical encounters and urging patients to enact agency in healthcare settings.This project discusses the interplay of these three discourses, and aims to improve diagnostic efficacy as a result. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility.This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden.In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions.Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging.Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery.Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted.Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patients endometriosis life.Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy.In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery.Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach. This study aims to examine the expression of p53, p16, and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein in normal endometrium and endometriosis, in order to discuss the role of p53, p16, and MDM2 protein and apoptosis in the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis, and provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.The immunohistochemical streptavidin-biotin peroxidase method was used to detect the expression of p53, p16, and MDM2 in tissue samples obtained from 30 women with pathologically confirmed ovarian endometriosis and 29 women with pathologically confirmed normal endometrium.The relationship between p53, p16, and MDM2 expression and apoptosis was analyzed.In normal endometrium, the positive rate of p53 in the secretory phase was higher than that in the proliferative phase (P < .05).Furthermore, the positive rate of p53 in normal endometrium was higher than that in ovarian endometriosis (P < .05).There was a significant difference between normal endometrium and ovarian endometriosis.The positive rate of p16 in normal endometrium was higher than that in ovarian endometriosis (P < .05).Furthermore, there was a significant difference between normal endometrium and ovarian endometriosis.The positive rate of MDM2 in normal endometrium was lower than that in ovarian endometriosis (P < .05).In ovarian endometriosis, the expression of p53 and p16 was positively correlated with each other (r = 0.611, P < .01).However, the expression of p53 and MDM2 was negatively correlated with each other (r = -0.541, P < .01).Furthermore, the expression of p16 and MDM2 might not be relevant in the endometriosis (r = 0.404, P > .05).As important apoptosis regulatory genes, p53, p16, and MDM2 might be involved in the pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which the endometrium, the layer of tissue that usually covers the inside of the uterus, grows outside the uterus.One of its severe effects is sub-fertility.The exact reason for endometriosis is still unknown and under investigation.Tracking the symptoms is not sufficient for diagnosing the disease.A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy.During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood.Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels.In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis.The Raman spectra of 94 serum samples acquired from 49 patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared for this study.Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k- Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in the analysis.According to the results (using 80 measurements for training and 14 measurements for the test set), it was found that kNN-weighted gave the best classification model with sensitivity and specificity values of 80.5% and 89.7%, respectively.Testing the model with unseen data yielded a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 100%.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which Raman spectroscopy was used in combination with PCA and classification algorithms as a non-invasive method applied on blood sera for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriosis, an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory disease, is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain.Here, we investigated the effects of linaclotide, a Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for IBS-C, in a rat model of endometriosis.Eight weeks after endometrium transplantation into the intestinal mesentery, rats developed endometrial lesions as well as vaginal hyperalgesia to distension and decreased mechanical hind paw withdrawal thresholds.Daily oral administration of linaclotide, a peripherally restricted guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist peptide acting locally within the gastrointestinal tract, increased pain thresholds to vaginal distension and mechanical hind paw withdrawal thresholds relative to vehicle treatment.Furthermore, using a cross-over design, administering linaclotide to rats previously administered vehicle resulted in increased hind paw withdrawal thresholds, whereas replacing linaclotide with vehicle treatment decreased hind paw withdrawal thresholds.Retrograde tracing of sensory afferent nerves from the ileum, colon, and vagina revealed that central terminals of these afferents lie in close apposition to one another within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.We also identified dichotomizing dual-labelled ileal/colon innervating afferents as well as colon/vaginal dual-labelled neurons and a rare population of triple traced ileal/colon/vaginal neurons within thoracolumbar DRG.These observations provide potential sources of cross-organ interaction at the level of the DRG and spinal cord.GC-C expression is absent in the vagina and endometrial cysts suggesting that the actions of linaclotide are shared through nerve pathways between these organs.In summary, linaclotide may offer a novel therapeutic option not only for treatment of chronic endometriosis-associated pain, but also for concurrent treatment of comorbid chronic pelvic pain syndromes. The aim of this study was to determine the expression and significance of miR-126 and miR-145 in endometrial tissues in the mid-luteal phase of patients with infertility due to endometriosis.It was an experimental study carried out from January 2016 to July 2017.A total of 47 infertile patients with endometriosis were selected as an endometriosis group, and classified as 22 cases (46.81%) in stage I-II and 25 cases (53.19%) in stage III-IV; while 47 women who were infertile due to male factors were selected as a control group.The research showed that the expression levels of miR-126 and miR-145 in endometriosis group were higher than those of the control group (both p<0.001).There was no significant difference in the expression levels of miR-126 and miR-145 between the I-II and III-IV patients (p=0.535 and 0.809, respectively).The expression levels of miR-126 and miR-145 in endometrial tissues of non-pregnant patients were significantly higher than those of pregnant patients (both p<0.001).In conclusion, the up-regulated expression of miR-126 and miR-145 in the endometrial tissues in the mid-luteal phase of patients may play a role in infertility due to endometriosis. OBJECTIVE To determine long-term outcome for rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with endometriosis that underwent surgical treatment and identify factors potentially associated with long-term outcome.DESIGN Retrospective case series.ANIMALS 11 female rhesus macaques.PROCEDURES Medical records of female rhesus macaques in which endometriosis was diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 and that underwent abdominal exploratory surgery were reviewed.RESULTS In 5 macaques, the only clinical abnormality was a caudal abdominal mass identified during a routine physical examination, and in 6 macaques, overt clinical signs of endometriosis, including anorexia, dysmenorrhea, and lethargy during menses, were reported.Five macaques had histologically confirmed complete ovarian removal, and another 5 had incomplete ovarian removal (ovarian tissue was not examined histologically in 1 macaque).Nine animals survived at least 12 months after surgery, and 6 survived at least 60 months after surgery.Macaques that did not have overt clinical signs were significantly more likely to survive at least 60 months after surgery.However, extent of ovarian removal was not significantly associated with survival 12 or 60 months after surgery.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that, in select situations, surgery (ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy) may be curative in macaques with endometriosis and may result in long-term survival.Further, findings suggested that monitoring until clinical signs appear before performing surgery is not warranted in adult female macaques suspected to have endometriosis that only have a caudal abdominal mass and no other overt clinical signs. We retrospectively assessed the clinical and pathological features of 14 patients with thoracic endometriosis who were treated at our hospital from 2007 to 2017.Thirteen patients presented pneumothorax and 1 patient presented bloody sputum.All were treated surgically.Pneumothorax occurs on the right side in all 13 cases and bloody sputum was from left side lesion.Ten patients presented symptoms closely related with their menstrual cycle (days -2 to 5).At surgery, dark red or dark brown spots, small hiatus and scar-like findings on the surface of the visceral pleura or diaphragm were identified in all cases.Pathological or immunohistochemical examinations of diaphragm or lung tissue specimens revealed endometrial tissue in 6 cases of pneumothorax and a case of bloody sputum.Nine patients received hormonal therapy(8:pneumothorax, 1:bloody sputum).Pleurodesis was performed for 1 pneumothorax patient with recurrent pneumothorax after hormonal therapy.In case of young female with repeated pneumothorax, catamenial pneumothorax must be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis and appropriate timing for surgical treatment should be considered to establish pathologically correct diagnosis. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition characterized by severe pelvic pain and/or infertility.The combination of nonspecific symptoms and invasive laparoscopic diagnostics have prompted researchers to evaluate potential biomarkers that would enable a non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis.Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease thus different cytokines represent potential diagnostic biomarkers.As panels of biomarkers are expected to enable better separation between patients and controls we evaluated 40 different cytokines in plasma samples of 210 patients (116 patients with endometriosis; 94 controls) from two medical centres (Slovenian, Austrian).Results of the univariate statistical analysis showed no differences in concentrations of the measured cytokines between patients and controls, confirmed by principal component analysis showing no clear separation amongst these two groups.In order to validate the hypothesis of a more profound (non-linear) differentiating dependency between features, machine learning methods were used.We trained four common machine learning algorithms (decision tree, linear model, k-nearest neighbour, random forest) on data from plasma levels of proteins and patients clinical data.The constructed models, however, did not separate patients with endometriosis from the controls with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.This study thus indicates that plasma levels of the selected cytokines have limited potential for diagnosis of endometriosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that there is an interaction between the gut microbiota and endometriotic lesions.The new formation of these lesions is associated with stem cell recruitment, angiogenesis and inflammation, which may affect the composition of the gut microbiota.To test this hypothesis, we herein induced endometriotic lesions by transplantation of uterine tissue fragments from green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ donor mice into the peritoneal cavity of GFP- C57BL/6 wild-type mice.Sham-transplanted animals served as controls.Fecal pellets of the animals were collected 3 days before as well as 7 and 21 days after the induction of endometriosis to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota by means of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.The transplantation of uterine tissue fragments resulted in the establishment of endometriotic lesions in all analyzed mice.These lesions exhibited a typical histomorphology with endometrial glands surrounded by a vascularized stroma.Due to their bright GFP signal, they could be easily differentiated from the surrounding GFP- host tissue.Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were successfully PCR-amplified from the DNA extracts of all obtained mice fecal samples.However, no significant effect of endometriosis induction on the composition of the bacterial microbiota was detected with our experimental setup.Our findings allow careful speculation that endometriosis in mice does not induce pronounced dysbiosis during the acute phase of lesion formation. Pelvic endometriosis is a complex syndrome characterized by an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory process that affects primarily pelvic tissues, including the ovaries.It is caused when shed endometrial tissue travels retrograde into the lower abdominal cavity.Endometriosis is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain in women and is associated with infertility.The underlying pathologic mechanisms in the intracavitary endometrium and extrauterine endometriotic tissue involve defectively programmed endometrial mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells.Although endometriotic stromal cells, which compose the bulk of endometriotic lesions, do not carry somatic mutations, they demonstrate specific epigenetic abnormalities that alter expression of key transcription factors.For example, GATA-binding factor-6 overexpression transforms an endometrial stromal cell to an endometriotic phenotype, and steroidogenic factor-1 overexpression causes excessive production of estrogen, which drives inflammation via pathologically high levels of estrogen receptor-.Progesterone receptor deficiency causes progesterone resistance.Populations of endometrial and endometriotic epithelial cells also harbor multiple cancer driver mutations, such as KRAS, which may be associated with the establishment of pelvic endometriosis or ovarian cancer.It is not known how interactions between epigenomically defective stromal cells and the mutated genes in epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain is managed by suppression of ovulatory menses and estrogen production, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and surgical removal of pelvic lesions, and in vitro fertilization is frequently used to overcome infertility.Although novel targeted treatments are becoming available, as endometriosis pathophysiology is better understood, preventive approaches such as long-term ovulation suppression may play a critical role in the future. The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of microRNA (miR)33b in endometriosis (Ems).Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR), MTT assays, flow cytometry, caspase3/9 activity assays and western blotting were performed in the present study.Initially, miR33b expression in an Ems rat model was investigated by RTqPCR and was demonstrated to be upregulated in Ems tissue samples of rats compared with the control group.In addition, miR33b upregulation inhibited cell growth and enhanced apoptosis in an Ems model (primary cell cultures) compared with the control group.In addition, miR33b upregulation reduced Wnt/catenin signaling pathway and suppressed zinc finger Eboxbinding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) protein expression in the in vitro Ems model (primary cell cultures) compared with the control group.Furthermore, small interferingZEB1 ameliorated the effects of miR33b downregulation on Ems cell growth in the in vitro Ems model.Additionally, a Wnt agonist reduced the effects of miR33b upregulation on Ems cell growth in the in vitro Ems model.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that upregulation of miR33b may promote Ems through Wnt/catenin by ZEB1 expression. Endometriosis is an enigmatic condition with an unknown etiology and a poorly understood pathogenesis.It is considered to appear from the interplay of many genetic and environmental factors, affecting up to 10% of women and represents a major cause of pain and infertility.The familial association of endometriosis, as demonstrated through monozygotic twin and family studies suggests a genetic contribution to the disease, with further casecontrol and genomewide association studies (GWAS) detecting various endometriosis risk factors.In a recent study, we described a unique, threegeneration family of Cretan origin (Greece) with 7 females with surgically confirmed endometriosis (grandmother, 3 daughters and 3 granddaughters).All the affected members of this family displayed a variety of clinical manifestations and complications.In the present study, to further analyze the genetic variants conferring the risk of developing endometriosis, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed, using the AmpliSeq technology on the Ion Proton platform.An initial analysis of 64 variants that were detected across the 14 genes previously confirmed to be associated with endometriosis, did not identify any deleterious exonic variants in these genes.However, further analysis revealed 2 hemizygous deletions in the grandmother that segregate in several of her affected offspring.The first deletion was found in the UGT2B28 locus, spanning 7 informative sequence variants across at least 14 kb.The second deletion, located in USP17L2, spans 3 informative variants across at least 2 kb.On the whole, the findings of the presents study implicate 2 additional genes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, apart from those already identified by GWAS. Here, we describe a protocol for the implementation of a heterologous mouse model in which progression of endometriosis can be assessed in real time through noninvasive monitoring of fluorescence emitted by implanted ectopic human endometrial tissue.For this purpose, biopsies of human endometrium are obtained from donor women ongoing oocyte donation.Human endometrial fragments are cultured in the presence of adenoviruses engineered to express cDNA for the reporter fluorescent protein mCherry.Upon visualization, labeled tissues with an optimal rate of fluorescence after infection are subsequently chosen for the implantation in recipient mice.One week prior to the implantation surgery, recipient mice are oophorectomized, and estradiol pellets are placed subcutaneously to sustain the survival and growth of lesions.On the day of surgery mice are anesthetized, and peritoneal cavity accessed through a small (1.5 cm) incision by the linea-alba.Fluorescently labeled implants are tweezed, briefly soaked in glue and attached to the peritoneal layer.Incisions are sutured, and animals left to recover for a couple of days.Fluorescence emitted by endometriotic implants is usually non-invasively monitored every 3 days for 4 weeks with an in vivo imaging system.Variations in the size of endometriotic implants can be estimated in real time by quantification of the mCherry signal and normalization against the initial time-point showing maximal fluorescence intensity.Traditional preclinical rodents of models of endometriosis do not allow non-invasive monitoring of lesion in real time but rather allow evaluation of the effects of drugs assayed at the end point.This protocol allows one to track lesions in real time and is more useful to explore the therapeutic potential of drugs in preclinical models of endometriosis.The main limitation of the model thus generated is that non-invasive monitoring is not possible over long periods of time due to the episomal expression of Ad-virus. High prevalence of endometriosis was reported in Asian women as a result of their traditionally high intake of soy foods during infancy.Soy is widely used in infant feeding after weaning from breast milk or cow milk.This study thus aimed to determine to what extent soy intake before puberty may contribute to the development of endometriosis.For this purpose, immature (6-week old) female rats were fed with various soy formulas (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%).Normal control animals were fed with a soy-free diet.At 13 weeks of age, animals (except the normal control) underwent a transplantation surgery to establish endometriosis.Estradiol valerate and oxytocin were used to induce pelvic pain.Endometrial implant levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) allowed estimating tissue oxidative status.Physiological ovarian function was assessed by histological analysis of ovaries.Results showed that soy-fed animals grew faster than animals receiving a soy-free diet (P < .001).In animals supplemented with more than 10% of soy, the intensity of pelvic pain increased (P < .001) as well as the volume of ectopic foci.In addition, tissue levels of MDA and GSH increased (P < .001).The ovarian function was altered and the number of luteinized unruptured follicles increased.In conclusion, although animals supplemented with soy at the prepubertal stage displayed a good growth performance, regular soy consumption may promote the development and progress of endometriosis in adulthood, especially when soy content in food is more than 10%. This study presents the postoperative pregnancy rate of women with recurrent endometriosis and evaluates the predictive value of the endometriosis fertility index (EFI) for the pregnancy.A total of 107 women who wished to conceive after surgery for recurrent endometriosis from January 2007 to December 2016 were included.The EFI score was calculated postoperatively.The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to determine the most promising contributor to predicting pregnancy, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis was used to estimate the cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR).A total of 61 pregnancies were registered in 58 women and the remaining 49 patients failed to become pregnant.The EFI score was strongly associated with the postoperative fertility prognosis.The CPRs during the first 2 and 3 years postoperatively were 51.86% and 66.38%, respectively, and increased to 71.98% within the first 5 years postoperatively in patients with EFI scores 5.However, the CPR was 26.00% during the first 2 years after surgery in individuals with EFI scores <5, and there was no increase in the CRP thereafter.Women suffering from recurrent endometriosis still experienced a probability of natural pregnancy, especially patients with EFI scores 5.The EFI score had good predictive power for postoperative pregnancy in these patients. Epidemiologic and histopathologic associations between endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer have been reported; however, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well understood.A possible genetic link has been suggested in recent publications.Driver mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, ARID1A, and other genes have been found in the epithelium of intrauterine endometrial tissue, ovarian and extraovarian pelvic endometriosis tissue, ovarian cancers associated with endometriosis (i.e., clear cell and endometrioid type), and other epithelial ovarian cancers.This makes sense because pelvic endometriosis occurs primarily as a result of retrograde menstruation and implantation of endometrial tissue fragments in ovarian inclusion cysts or extraovarian peritoneal or subperitoneal sites.Unlike epithelial cells, endometriotic stromal cells are mutation free but contain widespread epigenetic defects that alter gene expression and induce a progesterone-resistant and intensely inflammatory environment, driven by estrogen via estrogen receptor-.The resulting increased estrogenic action in the stroma drives inflammation and sends paracrine signals to neighboring epithelial cells to enhance proliferation.In addition, massively high concentrations of estrogen in the ovary may exert an additional and direct genotoxic effect on DNA and cause accumulation of additional mutations and malignant transformation in initially mutated endometriotic epithelial cells in an ovarian endometrioma, which may initiate epithelial ovarian cancer.The same epithelial mutations and inflammatory processes in stroma are seen in extraovarian deep-infiltrating endometriosis, but carcinogenesis does not occur.We provide a focused review of the literature and discuss the implications of recent genetic breakthroughs linking endometriosis and ovarian cancer. Elagolix, an orally active non-peptidic GnRH antagonist, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.As the degree of ovarian suppression obtained with elagolix is dose-dependent, pain relief may be achieved by modulating the level of hypo-oestrogenism while limiting side effects.Elagolix may thus be considered a novelty in terms of its endocrine and pharmacological properties but not for its impact on the pathogenic mechanisms of endometriosis, as the target of this new drug is, yet again, alteration of the hormonal milieu.Given the oestrogen-dependent nature of endometriosis, a reduction of side effects may imply a proportionate decrease in pain relief.Furthermore, if low elagolix doses are used, ovulation is not consistently inhibited, and patients should use non-hormonal contraceptive systems and perform serial urine pregnancy tests to rule out unplanned conception during periods of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.If high elagolix doses are used to control severe pain for long periods of time, add-back therapies should be added, similar to that prescribed when using GnRH agonists.To date, the efficacy of elagolix has only been demonstrated in placebo-controlled explanatory trials.Pragmatic trials comparing elagolix with low-dose hormonal contraceptives and progestogens should be planned to verify the magnitude of the incremental benefit, if any, of this GnRH antagonist over currently used standard treatments.The price of elagolix may impact on patient adherence and, hence, on clinical effectiveness.In the USA, the manufacturer AbbVie Inc. priced elagolix (OrilissaTM) at around $10 000 a year, i.e.$845 per month.When faced with unaffordable treatments, some patients may choose to forego care.If national healthcare systems are funded by the tax payer, the approval and the use of a new costly drug to treat a chronic condition, such as endometriosis, means that some finite financial resources will be diverted from other areas, or that similar patients will not receive the same level of care.Thus, defining the overall value of a new drug for endometriosis also has ethical implications, and trade-offs between health outcomes and costs should be carefully weighed up. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression proles in tubal endometriosis (EM) are still poorly understood.In this study, we analyzed the differential expression of miRNAs and the related gene networks and signaling pathways in tubal EM.Four tubal epithelium samples from tubal EM patients and five normal tubal epithelium samples from uterine leiomyoma patients were collected for miRNA microarray.Bioinformatics analyses, including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, were performed.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation of five miRNAs was performed in six tubal epithelium samples from tubal EM and six from control.A total of 17 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and 4343 potential miRNA-target genes involved in tubal EM were identified (fold change >1.5 and FDR-adjusted P value <0.05).IPA indicated connections between miRNAs, target genes and other gynecological diseases like endometrial carcinoma.GO and KEGG analysis revealed that most of the identified genes were involved in the mTOR signaling pathway, SNARE interactions in vesicular transport and endocytosis.We constructed an miRNA-gene-disease network using target gene prediction.Functional analysis showed that the mTOR pathway was connected closely to tubal EM.Our results demonstrate for the first time the differentially expressed miRNAs and the related signal pathways involved in the pathogenesis of tubal EM which contribute to elucidating the pathogenic mechanism of tubal EM-related infertility. Endometriosis is associated with benign but adversely developed cysts in the extrauterine environment.The oxidative imbalanced environment induces DNA damage and affects cell cycle progression of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial epithelial cells, but how endometriotic cells maintain proliferation in the presence of oxidative stress is not clear.Growing evidence has indicated that the ectopic hypoxic microenvironment and oxidative stress can stimulate the growth of endometriotic cells, which is mainly due to the increase of HIF-1.We found that the master hypoxia-associated miRNA miR-210-3p was increased in stromal and glandular cells of ectopic lesions compared with that of eutopic and normal endometria and was consistent with the expression of HIF-1 and the local oxidative stress-induced DNA damage predictor 8-OHdG.Moreover, miR-210-3p was upregulated in ESCs and Ishikawa cells under hypoxic conditions but not in normoxic culture.Knockdown of miR-210-3p induced a G2/M arrest of ESCs and Ishikawa cells under hypoxia, while no effect was found under normoxia.BARD1 was identified as a target of miR-210-3p.BARD1 expression was decreased in endometriotic tissues compared with eutopic and normal endometria and negatively correlated with the expression of miR-210-3p.Multivariate regression analysis showed that BARD1 downregulation could serve as an indicator for endometriotic severity.Our results suggest that miR-210-3p attenuates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint by inactivating BRCA1 complex function in response to DNA damage under hypoxia via targeting the 3 untranslated region of BARD1 mRNA.Endometriotic mouse model experiments showed that intraperitoneal injection of the miR-210-3p inhibitor or vitamin C suppressed the growth of endometriotic lesions.Together, our results demonstrate that endometriotic cells inhibit BARD1/BRCA1 function by upregulating miR-210-3p, which might be the underlying mechanism for endometriotic cell maintenance of growth in oxidative stress.Furthermore, inhibition of miR-210-3p and administration of vitamin C are promising approaches for the treatment of endometriosis. Sexual dysfunctions, particularly sexual pain, are common in adult women of all ages.In patients with endometriosis, a chronic gynecological pain condition affecting women of reproductive age, sexual pain is the third most common symptom.Multiple biological factors are involved in endometriosis-related sexual pain including tissue damage, inflammation, hormonal changes, alterations within the peripheral and central nervous system and pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions.Conceptual models of sexual pain espouse a multifactorial view, with empirical evidence suggesting the implication of psychosexual and relationship difficulties in the development and persistence of sexual pain and associated distress.We review literature on the biological, psychological, sexual and interpersonal factors associated with development and persistence of sexual pain in women with endometriosis.In addition, we discuss chronic pain conditions frequently associated with endometriosis (vulvodynia, bladder pain syndrome and inflammatory bowel syndrome) and how they are linked with sexual pain.Finally we discuss the clinical implications and provided suggestions for future research and medical care, focusing on a multidisciplinary and biopsychosocial approach. Interleukin (IL)-34 plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation and immunoregulation.Numerous diseases can be attributed to the dysregulation of IL-34 signaling.This study was performed to investigate the function of IL-34 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Firstly, by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay, we found that IL-34, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were increased in the sera of patients with endometriosis.Secondly, exposure to IL-34 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs).Additionally, stimulation with IL-34 up-regulated colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), p-JAK3, p-STAT6, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in these eutopic ESCs.Treatment with AS1517499, an inhibitor of STAT6, remarkably abrogated the alterations induced by IL-34.A Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated binding of STAT6 to the IL-34 promoter, further implicating STAT6 in IL-34 signaling.Notably, reverse results were obtained in ectopic ESCs with the application of an IL-34 neutralizing antibody.In vivo, AS1517499 suppressed the maintenance of endometriosis lesions in rats.In summary, autocrine production of IL-34, mediated by STAT6, promoted the development of endometriosis in vitro and in vivo through the CSF1R/JAK3/STAT6 pathway.Our research reveals the function of IL-34 in endometriosis, which may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies for endometriosis. This study aimed to elucidate the roles and regulatory mechanism of miR-2861 in the development of endometriosis.The expression of miR-2861 in endometriotic tissues and eutopic endometrial tissues was determined.Ectopic endometrial cells were transfected with miR-2861 mimic, miR-2861 inhibitor and their corresponding controls.The effects of miR-2861 overexpression and inhibition on cell proliferation and apoptosis were then investigated.In addition, regulatory relationship between miR-2681 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was explored, as well as between STAT3 and MMP2.Compared with eutopic endometrial tissues, miR-2861 was significantly downregulated in endometriotic tissues.Overexpression of miR-2861 markedly inhibited ectopic endometrial cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.Additionally, STAT3 and MMP2 were confirmed as the targets of miR-2861, and the effects of knockdown of STAT3 or MMP2on regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis were opposite with inhibition of miR-2861.Besides, STAT3 could enhance the expression of MMP2 in ectopic endometrial cells.Our study reveals that miR-2861 was lowly expressed in endometriotic tissues, and downregulation of miR-2861 may promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of ectopic endometrial cells in endometriosis via upregulation of STAT3 and MMP2.miR-2861 may be a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for endometriosis. Most available therapies for endometriosis are hormone-based and generally broadly used without taking into consideration the ovarian hormone receptor expression status.This contrasts strikingly with the standard of care for other hormone-based conditions such as breast cancer.We therefore aimed to characterize the expression of ovarian steroid hormone receptors for estrogen alpha (ESR1), estrogen beta (ESR2), and progesterone (PGR) in different types of endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis and controls using a tissue microarray (TMA).Nuclear expression levels of the receptors were analyzed by tissue (ie, ectopic vs. eutopic endometrium) and cell type (ie, glands vs. stroma).Ovarian lesions showed the lowest expression of ESR1 and PGR, and the highest expression of ESR2, whereas the fallopian tube lesions showed high expression of the 3 receptors.Differences among endometria included lower expression of ESR1 and higher expression of ESR2 in stroma of proliferative endometrium from patients versus patients, and a trend towards loss of PGR nuclear positivity in proliferative endometrium from patients.The largest ESR2:ESR1 ratios were observed in ovarian lesions and secretory endometrium.The highest proportion of samples with >10% Ki67 positive nuclei was in glands of fallopian tube (54%) and extrapelvic lesions (75%); 60% of glands of secretory endometrium from patients had >10% Ki67 positivity compared with only 15% in controls.Our results provide a better understanding of endometriosis heterogeneity by revealing lesion type-specific differences and case-by-case variability in the expression of ovarian hormone receptors.This knowledge could potentially predict individual responses to hormone therapies, and set the basis for the application of personalized medicine approaches for women with endometriosis. The objective is to study the significance of altered interleukin levels in endometriosis-related infertility or pelvic pain.The present systematic review and meta-analysis includes a discussion on the roles of interleukin in the physiopathology of endometriosis-associated infertility and/or pelvic pain.We included all studies in which interleukins in peritoneal fluid, follicular fluid or serum from patients were measured and that correlated the findings with either peritoneal or deep endometriosis-associated infertility or pelvic pain.For the meta-analysis, we selected studies on the following cytokines: interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8).Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease.Inflammatory processes clearly participate in the etiology of endometriosis.Cytokines are mediators of inflammation, and increase in their concentration in plasma or other body fluids signals the presence and extent of tissue lesions.A number of studies have reported on the association between higher cytokine levels and progression or maintenance of endometriosis and coexisting infertility or pelvic pain.The results of the analyses support that an association exists between elevated serum IL-6 and/or IL-8 concentrations and the occurrence of endometriosis-associated infertility.Such association was not found for endometriosis-associated pain.In spite of accumulated evidence on the association of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endometriosis, it still is not clear if and how these mediators participate in the physiopathology of endometriosis-associated infertility or pelvic pain, in part due to poor quality of the evidence established in the vast majority of interleukins and challenges in endometriosis research reproducibility.In summary, the results of the analyses support that an association exists between elevated serum IL-6 and/or IL-8 concentrations and the occurrence of endometriosis-associated infertility. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) is a valuable primary imaging tool for the initial evaluation and management of endometriosis, a complex multifocal disease process with a varied spectrum of clinical and morphologic features that can substantially affect quality of life.The high accuracy of TVS for the detailed mapping of disease extent, an essential process for guiding treatment strategies, is well documented.The dynamic nature of US provides added value, revealing information that is not easily addressed with other imaging modalities.As recognized by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis Consensus Group, a dedicated standardized protocol that is used by experienced and knowledgeable operators is necessary for a complete evaluation.The four components of a dedicated TVS protocol for evaluation of pelvic endometriosis are (a) evaluation of the uterus and adnexa, (b) dedicated search for deep infiltrating endometriosis, (c) assessment of the sliding sign, and (d) detection of sonographic soft markers.These components are described, and the multiple locations and US findings of endometriosis within the pelvis are reviewed, with emphasis on the unique features of US as an extension of the physical examination.In addition to enabling evaluation of the static findings of adenomyosis, endometrioma, hydrosalpinx, hematosalpinx, and hypoechoic nodules of deep infiltrating endometriosis, dynamic TVS enables assessment of pouch of Douglas obliteration, organ mobility, and site-specific tenderness, as well as tenderness-guided imaging.The benefits of implementing a dedicated TVS protocol in terms of improved patient care are also discussed.Online supplemental material is available for this article.RSNA, 2019. Identification of biomarkers for endometriosis is an unmet medical need that demands to be fulfilled.In this study, we first used a mouse model of endometriosis and evaluated the potential utility of select biomarkers based on serial observations.Since fibrosis is the end result of lesional development, we chose high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), osteopontin (OPN), and hyaluronic acid (HA), all three of them have been well documented to be involved in endometriosis and fibrosis, as potential biomarkers.In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis of HMGB1, OPN, and the receptors for HMGB1, such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor B (NF-B), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), interleukin-33 (IL-33), and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE)-a pattern recognition receptor, with HMGB1 being its important ligand.We then evaluated the same set of putative markers in 30 women with ovarian endometriomas and 20 without endometriosis, and reevaluated the 3 plasma markers 3 months after the surgical removal of all visible endometriotic lesions.In mouse, the lesional staining levels of OPN, RAGE, and IL-33 were all significantly higher than that of normal endometrium, and increased progressively as lesions progressed.In contrast to HMGB1, TLR4, p-p65 and PCNA staining levels were decreased progressively.In humans, lesional staining levels of OPN correlated positively, while that of HMGB1 correlated negatively with the extent of fibrosis.All three plasma markers correlated positively with the extent of lesional fibrosis.Through this integrated approach, we identified plasma HMGB1, OPN and HA as promising admissible biomarkers for endometriosis. Estrogen receptor (ER) plays a critical role in endometriosis progression because cytoplasmic ER stimulates proinflammatory signaling in ectopic lesions and prevents apoptosis to promote their survival.However, the role of "nuclear ER" in endometriosis progression is not known.This critical knowledge gap obscures our understanding of the full molecular etiology of ER-mediated endometriosis progression.To fill this void, we generated an ER-regulated transcriptome and ER cistrome in ectopic lesions and the eutopic endometrium of mice with endometriosis by using a new endometrium-specific FLAG-tagged human ER overexpression mouse model.The integration of these omics data sets revealed that ER stimulated the proliferation activities of ectopic lesions and the eutopic endometrium by directly upregulating MYC and E2 transcription factor target genes and genes associated with the G2/M transition.Additionally, ER stimulated gene expression associated with TNF/nuclear factor B (NF-B) signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reactive oxygen species signaling, IL-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 signaling, and hypoxia signaling and suppressed IFN signaling in ectopic lesions to enhance endometriosis progression.ER also stimulated gene expression associated with the unfolded protein response and IL-6/JAK/STAT3 inhibitory signaling and suppressed TNF/NF-B signaling in the eutopic endometrium to cause endometriosis-associated endometrial dysfunction.Therefore, nuclear ER-regulated gene networks provide critical clues to understand the molecular etiology and complexity of endometriosis and endometriosis-associated endometrial dysfunction. Oxidative stress and dysregulation of antioxidant systems are associated with various complications in pregnancy.Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disease that affects women of reproductive age.Recent studies have indicated that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of endometriosis.It has been reported that microRNAs can regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress, and mounting evidence indicates that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an essential role in the regulation of systemic redox capacity.In the present study, we demonstrated that miR455 is a putative FABP4targeting miRNA.A luciferase activity assay revealed that miR455 can successfully bind to the 3UTR of FABP4.Overexpression of miR455 led to the downregulation of FABP4 at both the mRNA and protein levels in a human endometrial stromal cell line.Then, the roles of miR455 and FABP4 in oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human endometrial stromal cells were examined.We found that ectopic expression of miR455 protected cells from damage caused by H2O2.Further investigation found that forced expression of miR455 reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), while the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were promoted.Silencing of FABP4 also generated cytoprotective effects against H2O2 in human endometrial stromal cells.Moreover, overexpression FABP4 abrogated the miR455mediated antioxidative stress effects in cells.Taken together, we propose that miR455 protects human endometrial stromal cells from oxidative stress at least partly via regulation of FABP4. This study was aimed to explore the correlation between catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene polymorphisms and endometriosis susceptibility in Chinese Han population.This case-control study recruited 134 endometriosis patients and 139 healthy individuals.COMT gene rs4680, rs2020917, and rs4646312 polymorphisms in the subjects were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.Association between COMT polymorphisms and endometriosis susceptibility was evaluated by test and adjusted by Logistic regression.Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to present the relative risk of endometriosis.A allele of rs4680 was distinctly correlated with increased susceptibility of endometriosis (OR = 1.450, 95% CI = 1.012-2.076).However, when adjusted by the confounding factors, these associations become not significant.We failed to find any significant association between rs2020917 and endometriosis risk in the crude results.The adjusted results suggested that rs2020917 TT genotype and T allele were distinctly correlated with enhanced endometriosis risk (TT vs CC: P = .038, OR = 2.894, 95% CI = 1.060-7.903; T vs C: P = .039, OR = 1.481, 95% CI = 1.021-2.149).Besides, rs4646312 C allele was significantly correlated with endometriosis risk both in the crude (P = .027, OR = 1.502, 95% CI = 1.047-2.154) and adjusted (P = .019, OR = 1.564, 95% CI = 1.078-2.269) results.COMT polymorphisms might predict the occurrence of endometriosis. This study means to investigate a combination of noninvasive methods in diagnosis of minimal or mild endometriosis expecting to narrow down the range of laparoscopic exploration for female infertility.It is a retrospective case control study of totally 447 patients suspected unexplained infertility before surgery were eligible from May 2012 to February 2017.Of these, 299 patients were laparoscopy-proved minimal or mild endometriosis group, the remaining 148 patients served as control group (normal pelvis).Preoperative age, duration of infertility, type of infertility, body mass index, baseline follicle-stimulating hormone, anti-Mllerian hormone, serum CA125, clinical symptoms, findings on vagino-recto-abdominal examinations and pregnancy prognosis had been recorded.Every variable and their combinations were evaluated.Any single factor had limited diagnostic value.The cut-off value for CA125 was 19.25 IU/L.Parallel testing had a higher sensitivity at 81.3%.Serial tests of vagino-recto-abdominal examination combined with dysmenorrhea or positive CA125 got reasonable sensitivity (51.4% and 49%), remarkable high specificities (95.7% and100%) and Positive Predictive Value (96.4% and 100%).Multivariate logistic regression identified the following factors in decreasing order of importance: (1) vagino-recto-abdominal examinations, (2) CA125, (3) dysmenorrhea, their ORs being 16.148, 3.796, and 2.809, respectively.The spontaneous pregnancy rate (50.8%) in minimal or mild endometriosis was higher than control (35.6%, P = .043).A combination of noninvasive diagnostic methods had certain preoperative diagnostic value of minimal or mild endometriosis, which might benefit some patients from avoiding laparoscopic surgery. The exact mechanism of endometriosis is unknown.The recommendation system (RS) based on item similarities of machine learning has never been applied to the relationship between diseases.The study aim was to identify diseases associated with endometriosis by applying RS based on item similarities to insurance data in South Korea.Women aged 15 to 45 years extracted from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service National Inpatient Sample (HIRA-NIS) 2009-2015.We used the RS model to extract diseases that were correlated with an endometriosis diagnosis.Among women aged 15 to 45 years, endometriosis was defined as a diagnostic code of N80.x and a concurrent treatment code.A control group was defined as women who did not have the N80.x code.Benign breast diseases, cystitis, and non-toxic goitre were extracted by the RS.A total of 1,730,562 women were selected as the control group, and 11,273 women were selected as the endometriosis group.In logistic regression analysis adjusted for age per 5 years, data year, and socioeconomic status, benign neoplasm of breast (odds ratio (OR): 2.58; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.90-3.50), other cystitis (OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.56-4.44), and non-toxic single thyroid nodule (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.14-2.32) were statistically significant.Endometriosis was associated with benign breast disease, cystitis, and non-toxic goitre. A diagnosis of endometriosis is based upon the histological identification of endometrial tissue at ectopic sites which are commonly located on the pelvic organs, the peritoneum and ovary.In rare cases, ectopic lesions can be found in other organs, such as kidney, bladder, lung or brain.Diagnosis is achieved by laparoscopic intervention followed by histological confirmation of endometriotic tissue.Prevalence is estimated at approximately 10% in the general female population with many patients experiencing pain and/or infertility.Currently, the implantation hypothesis by Sampson is the most accepted hypothesis about the pathogenesis of endometriosis.However, the occurrence of endometriosis in patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome who sometimes lack a uterus or endometrium seems to suggest metaplasia as a cause of endometriosis.A critical reevaluation of the literature about MRKH does not reveal conclusive evidence of an association of uterus/endometrium agenesis and endometriosis.Most often only MRI diagnoses of uterus/endometrium agenesis and only very rarely conclusive histological evidence of the endometriotic lesions are presented.In contrast, whenever biopsies were performed endometriosis always appeared together with uterus/endometrium remnants.Taken together, we suggest that MRKH patients only develop endometriosis if a uterus/endometrium is present which underscores and not contradicts the implantation hypothesis of Sampson. The presence and growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity in endometriosis patients are primarily driven by hormone-dependent and inflammatory processes-the latter being frequently associated with severe, acute, and chronic pelvic pain.The EP4 subtype of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors (EP4-R) is a particularly promising anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive target as both this receptor subtype and the pathways forming PGE2 are highly expressed in endometriotic lesions.High-throughput screening resulted in the identification of benzimidazole derivatives as novel hEP4-R antagonists.Careful structure-activity relationship investigation guided by rational design identified a methyl substitution adjacent to the carboxylic acid as an appropriate means to accomplish favorable pharmacokinetic properties by reduction of glucuronidation.Further optimization led to the identification of benzimidazolecarboxylic acid BAY 1316957, a highly potent, specific, and selective hEP4-R antagonist with excellent drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties.Notably, treatment with BAY 1316957 can be expected to lead to prominent and rapid pain relief and significant improvement of the patients quality of life. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent and progesterone-resistant gynecological inflammatory disease of reproductive-age women.Current hormonal therapies targeting estrogen can be prescribed only for a short time.It indicates a need for non-hormonal therapy.ERK1/2 and AKT pathways control several intracellular signaling molecules that control growth and survival of cells.Objectives of the present study are to determine the dual inhibitory effects of ERK1/2 and AKT pathways: (i) on proliferation, survival, and apoptosis of human endometrioitc epithelial cells and stromal cells in vitro; (ii) on growth and survival of endometrioitc lesions in vivo in xenograft mouse model of endometriosis of human origin; and (iii) establish the associated ERK1/2 and AKT downstream intracellular signaling modules in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Our results indicated that combined inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT pathways highly decreased the growth and survival of human endometriotic epithelial cells and stromal cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of endometriotic lesions in vivo compared to inhibition of either ERK1/2 or AKT pathway individually.This cause-effect is associated with dysregulated intracellular signaling modules associated with cell cycle, cell survival, and cell apoptosis pathways.Collectively, our results indicate that dual inhibition of ERK1/2 and AKT pathways could emerge as potential non-hormonal therapy for the treatment of endometriosis. In the present study, we summarize the role of the shared and independent (epi)genetic background between endometrioid carcinoma (EC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), two histological subtypes of endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC).Using the PubMed database, we conducted a literature review of various studies related to the malignant transformation of endometriosis.Both endometriosis and EAOC face potential environmental hazards, including hemoglobin (Hb), heme and free iron, which induces DNA damage and mutations.Although EC is distinguished from CCC due to different morphologies, both represent common environmental profiles and maintain the similar (epi)genomic abnormalities with multiple overlaps and share similar molecular signatures.By contrast, EAOC also has disease-specific gene signatures corresponding with each histological subtype: Estrogen receptor promotes EC cell proliferation (go) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) induces CCC cell cycle arrest (stop) under oxidative stress conditions.This model underscores a subtype-dependent go or stop dichotomy, possibly through better ability to adapt in a changing environment.It was found that cyst fluid Hb and iron concentrations were significantly lower in EAOC when compared to benign ovarian endometrioma (OE), supporting the hypothesis that the redox imbalance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of EAOC.There are at least two phases of iron carcinogenesis and tumor progression: The initial wave of iron-induced oxidative stress and DNA mutations would be followed by the second big wave of subsequent synthesis of the antioxidants, which diminishes cellular oxidative stress capacity, increases apoptosis resistance and promotes tumor initiation and progression.Special emphasis is given to novel pathophysiological concepts of malignant transformation of endometriosis. BACKGROUND Endometriosis is defined as the growth of ectopic endometrial tissue beyond the uterine cavity, and endometriosis on the uterine cervix is a rare variant.Although asymptomatic patients with cervical endometriosis or those with minor symptoms are treated conservatively, there are reports of life-threatening hemorrhage due to cervical endometriosis.Here, we report 2 cases of massive genital bleeding caused by cervical endometriotic cysts and we performed a literature review.CASE REPORT Case 1: A 32-year-old woman presented to our hospital due to massive genital bleeding on her 11th day of menstruation.An arterial hemorrhage in a cervical endometriotic cyst was suspected.As pressure hemostasis proved difficult, urgent uterine artery embolization (UAE) by interventional radiology was performed.Angiography during the UAE showed extravascular leakage from the branch of the left uterine artery.After embolization, hemostasis was achieved.No further genital bleeding was observed, and transvaginal ultrasound showed the cyst has continued to shrink for 9 months after the UAE with sequential dienogest, a progesterone receptor agonist, treatment.Case 2: A 43-year-old woman presented to our hospital with increasing massive genital bleeding after completing a 12-day course of 0.5 mg of norgestrel and 0.05 mg of ethinyl estradiol as a treatment for irregular intermenstrual bleeding.We suspected cervical endometriotic cyst rupture on imaging and performed an urgent laparoscopic total hysterectomy.In the excised uterine specimen, a cystic lesion that contained old, blood-like fluid was macroscopically observed in the cervix and was diagnosed pathologically as endometriosis.CONCLUSIONS Cervical endometriotic cyst rupture is rare; however, it should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis when treating massive genital bleeding because urgent intervention is sometimes required to control the bleeding. Immune cells and cytokines have important roles in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.However, the production and role of cytokines of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells in the progress of endometriosis have remained to be fully elucidated.The present study reported that the interferon (IFN)- levels and the percentage of IFN-+CD4+ cells were significantly increased in the peritoneal fluid (PF) at the early stage and maintained at a higher level at the advanced stage of endometriosis; furthermore, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-10+CD4+ cells were elevated in the advanced stage of endometriosis.In addition, IL-2 levels in the PF at the advanced stage of endometriosis were elevated and negatively associated with IFN- expression.In a co-culture system of ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and macrophages, elevated IL-2 was observed, and treatment with cytokines IL-2 and transforming growth factor- led to upregulation of the ratio of IL-2+ macrophages.IL-27-overexpressing ESCs and macrophages were able to induce a higher ratio of IL-10+CD4+ T cells.Blocking of IL-2 with anti-IL-2 neutralizing antibody led to upregulation of the ratio of IFN-+CD4+ T cells in the co-culture system in vitro.Recombinant human IL-10 and IFN- promoted the viability, invasiveness and transcription levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 of ESCs, particularly combined treatment with IL-10 and IFN-.These results suggest that IL-2 and IL-27 synergistically promote the growth and invasion of ESCs by modulating the balance of IFN- and IL-10 and contribute to the progress of endometriosis. Endometriosis shares similarities with several autoimmune diseases.The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C genotype is associated with several human autoimmune diseases.HLA-C is a ligand of killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) and is an essential regulator of natural killer cell activity, which is associated with endometriosis progression.Polymorphisms in HLA-C and KIR affect the activity of NK cells and susceptibility to several diseases.Therefore, we attempted to investigate an association between HLA-C genotype and KIR polymorphism and the occurrence of endometriosis.We tested the association of certain KIR and HLA-C combinations and the development of endometriosis by characterizing both KIR and HLA-C genes in 147 women with endometriosis and 117 controls.The HLA-C genotypes and KIR polymorphisms were analyzed via DNA-based method for higher-resolution genotyping.We found that the occurrence of HLA-C*03:03*01 was increased in endometriosis than in control groups.Analysis of various KIR haplotypes revealed differences between the endometriosis and control cohorts.The number of KIR centromeric A/A haplotypes was increased in the endometriosis group than controls.Moreover, the endometriosis cohort was characterized by reduced number of KIR2DS2-positive individuals in the Han Chinese population.Our current findings suggest that the KIR and HLA-C genotypes are associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Apoptosis and antioxidant mechanisms are pathways for the treatment of endometriosis (Endo).Rutin (Rtn) is an antioxidant flavonol that induces apoptosis.This study, for first time, was conducted to evaluate the effects of rutin on Endo through apoptosis and antioxidant mechanisms.The experimental Endo was induced in 24 rats and then the animals were subdivided into Endo-sole, 3000 and 6000 g/kg rutin (Rtn-3000 and Rtn-6000) and vitamin C groups.After 4 weeks, the expression of Bcl2, Bax, anti Pro Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-9, pro PARP, pro Cleaved PARP, Pro PARP, pro mTOR and mTOR were assessed by western blotting technique.The protein concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity, and super oxide dismutase and gutathione peroxidase were also evaluated.TUNEL staining was also used for the detection of apoptosis.Caspase-9 and concentration of antioxidants were higher in the treated groups compared to Endo-sole group (P < 0.05).The results also showed that rutin decreased the expression of Bcl2 and MDA concentration (P < 0.05).The results for TUNEL staining showed that the animals treated with Rtn-6000 and vitamin C showed higher apoptosis.Rutin induces apoptosis by the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase and also antioxidant activity by increasing antioxidants concentrations. BACKGROUND The role of gamma-synuclein (SNCG) has been widely examined in malignant conditions due to its possible role in disease progression, but very little information is available on its theoretical function on endometriosis formation.MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2016 and December 2016, we collected peritoneal fluid and plasma samples from 45 consecutive female patients, of which 15 were without endometriosis, 15 had minimal to mild endometriosis, and 15 had moderate to severe endometriosis.The statistical power was 0.98.We evaluated SNCG levels in the peritoneal fluid and plasma of patients diagnosed with endometriosis, and we compared them with the levels obtained from disease-free control subjects by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.RESULTS SNCG levels were statistically significantly (1.2-fold) higher in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis compared to controls (p=0.04).We did not find a significant difference between SNCG levels in the plasma of our endometriosis patients and the control group (p=0.086).However, despite previous data showing very limited expression of SNCG in healthy tissues, we found SNCG in the peritoneal fluid of all of the patients in our healthy control group.CONCLUSIONS Levels of SNCG were statistically significantly higher in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis compared to disease-free controls, which may indicate its possible role the formation and progression of the disease.Moreover, its biological function should be further investigated due to the conflicting results concerning its expression in healthy tissues. The diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis (TE) is challenging, hence resulting in under-diagnosis as well as long delays before arriving at a correct definitive diagnosis.Our aim is to review the histopathological findings in TE, summarise the diagnostic features, identify any major histo-morphological indicator(s) hitherto unrecognised as such, suggest diagnostic criteria; all with the aim of improving the diagnostic capacity and reducing observer error even where the clinical suspicion is low.A case-control study in which a search in the pathology archives of a referral hospital over a 10-year period was conducted.Twenty-six cases of TE were identified, reviewed, and compared with a control population of 48 cases taken from common benign thoracic diseases.Nine notable histological features were identified in varying permutations in the test group, namely: endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid macrophages, siderophages, cholesterol crystals, capillary congestion, multinucleated giant cells, smooth muscle bundles and fibrosis.The first 6 features were frequent; each being present in over 13 (13/26; 50%) test cases.The first 8 features showed significant association with TE by the Chi-squared test (P<0.05).In this group, the strength of association is high for the first 4 features (Cramrs V0.5).The presence of ceroid macrophages is shown to be a novel key feature, previously unrecognised as such, for the identification of TE.The presence of any three of four features including endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid macrophages and siderophages is a suggested criterion for the definitive diagnosis of TE. Endometriosis (EMS) is a common disease in women aged 2545 years, and pain is the main clinical symptom.The primary clinical treatment is surgical excision and drug therapy targeting the ectopic lesions, but these have not been very effective.Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BTXA) has been reported to be useful in the treatment of pain in a variety of diseases.Based on this, the aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of BTXA on EMS.A model of nerve injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) was constructed in PC12 cells and EMS mice.Model cells and mice were treated with different concentrations of BTXA to observe the changes in pain behavior, to detect cell viability and the secretion of norepinephrine (NE) and methionine enkephalin (MEK) in cells and the spinal cord, and to evaluate the expression of apoptosisrelated molecules in spinal cord nerves.The results revealed that BTXA significantly reduced the amount of writhing in model mice, enhanced the activity of PC12 OGD cells, increased the secretion of NE and MEK in model cells and the spinal cord of mice, and decreased the apoptosis of neural cells in the spinal cord of the model mice.Therefore, it was hypothesized that BTXA may alleviate the pain induced by EMS by increasing the secretion of analgesic substances and promoting the repair of nerve injury.The present study provided a theoretical basis for the treatment of pain induced by EMS. Adenomyosis and endometriosis are common causes of pelvic pain in women of reproductive age.Furthermore, adenomyosis is a major cause of menorrhagia.This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Etonogestrel implants on pelvic pain and menstrual flow in women requiring long-acting reversible contraception and suffering from adenomyosis or endometriosis.One hundred women with adenomyosis or endometriosis and asking for contraception with Etonogestrel implants were enrolled in this study and were followed-up for 24 months.Patients were interviewed on pelvic pain by visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, menstrual flow by the number of sanitary napkins, menstrual bleeding pattern, weight gain, breast pain, and any other treatment side effects.Seventy four patients who were treated with Etonogestrel implants completed the 24-month follow-up in which we found a significant decrease in pelvic pain VAS scores comparing baseline scores to 6, 12, and 24 months (baseline: 6.39 2.35 to 24-month: 0.17 0.69, P < 0.05).The menstrual volume decreased significantly compared with that at baseline ((40.69 30.92) %, P < 0.05).However, vaginal bleeding, amenorrhea, weight gain, and acne occurred after treatment in some patients.Etonogestrel implants were effective in reducing pelvic pain and menstrual flow of adenomyosis or endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 176 million women worldwide, yet on average, women experience pain 10 years from symptom onset before being properly diagnosed.Standard treatments (drugs or surgery) often fail to provide long-term pain relief.Elevated levels of reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) have been implicated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and upon accumulation, reactive aldehydes can form protein-adducts and/or generate pain.A key enzyme in detoxifying reactive aldehydes to less reactive forms is the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2).Here, we tested the hypothesis that aberrant reactive aldehyde detoxification by ALDH2 underlies endometriosis and its associated pain.We determined, in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with severe (stage IV) peritoneal endometriosis, that ALDH2 enzyme activity was decreased, which was associated with decreased ALDH2 expression and increased 4-HNE adduct formation compared to the eutopic endometrium of controls in the proliferative phase.Using a rodent model of endometriosis and an ALDH2*2 knock-in mouse with decreased ALDH2 activity, we determined that increasing ALDH2 activity with the enzyme activator Alda-1 could prevent endometriosis lesion development as well as alleviate pain-associated behaviors in proestrus.Overall, our findings suggest that targeting the ALDH2 enzyme in endometriosis may lead to better treatment strategies and in the proliferative phase, that increased 4-HNE adduct formation within the endometrium may serve as a less invasive diagnostic biomarker to reduce years of suffering in women. Resveratrol is a phytochemical with anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.The present study has evaluated the effect of resveratrol on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor- (TGF-) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as factors related to endometriosis progression.Thirteen eutopic (EuESCs) and 8 ectopic (EESCs) endometrial stromal cells from women with endometriosis and 11 control endometrial stromal cells (CESCs) were treated with resveratrol (100 M) for 6, 24 and 48 h. The gene and protein expression levels of VEGF, TGF-, and MMP-9 were measured using real-time PCR and ELISA methods, respectively.Results showed that the basal gene and protein expression of VEGF and MMP-9 were higher in EESCs compared to EuESCs and CESCs (P < 0.01 to < 0.001 and P < 0.05 to < 0.01 respectively).Also, resveratrol treatment decreased the gene and protein expression of VEGF and MMP-9 in EuESCs, EESCs and CESCs (P < 0.05 to < 0.01 and P < 0.05 to < 0.01 respectively) and gene and protein expression of TGF- in EESCs and EuESCs (P < 0.05 to < 0.01).The effect of resveratrol in reduction of VEGF gene expression was statistically more noticeable in EESCs compared to EuESCs and CESCs (P < 0.05).According to the findings, resveratrol may ameliorate endometriosis progression through reducing the expression of VEGF, TGF-, and MMP-9 in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). To investigate the influence factors of laparoscopic postoperative pregnancy of patients with endometriosis and infertility, further validate the application of EFI scoring system in endometriosis, and to improve the pregnancy rate.A total of 258 patients with endometriosis and infertility who underwent laparoscopic surgery and follow-up treatment at Wuxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016 were selected and divided into pregnant and non-pregnant groups according to whether they were pregnant.All patients were divided into 4 groups according to EFI score: group with EFI score 9, 7-8, 4-6, and <4, and divided into I, II, III, and IV groups according to AFS stages.The uterus-laparoscopic surgery was performed.The patients were followed up for 3 years.The factors affecting the pregnancy rate were analyzed.The pregnancy rate and pregnancy types were calculated at different time points.Multivariate analysis showed that age <35 years, infertility time <5 years, secondary infertility, EFI score, postoperative ART application were protection factors of postoperative pregnancy.The 3-year cumulative postoperative pregnancy rate was 75.6%.The cumulative pregnancy rate was 92.2% in group with EFI score 9, 85.9% in group with EFI score 7-8, 62.5% in group with EFI score 4-6 and 5.9% in group with EFI score <4, there was significant difference between the 4 groups (P < .05).The proportion of pregnancies in 6 months and 12 months was higher in patients with EFI score 7, 61.0% in patients with EFI score 9 and 41.1% in patients with EFI score 7.The highest natural pregnancy rate was 83.1% in group with EFI score 9, and there was significant difference between the 4 groups (P < .05).Age <35 years, infertility time <5 years, secondary infertility, EFI score and ART application were the protective factors of postoperative pregnancy.EFI score had positive significance in predicting and guiding the postoperative pregnancy of patients with endometriosis and infertility.According to EFI score, the pregnancy rate of patients with endometriosis and infertility can be significantly improved by strict management and active pregnancy program. This study aimed to analyse the effects of clotrimazole (CTZ) on estrogen production pathway in endometriosis progression.Experimental endometriosis was induced by autologous transplantation in female Wistar rats, and then the rats were treated with clotrimazole (200 mg/kg) or vehicle, both orally and intraperitoneally, for 15 consecutive days.Serum estrogen levels and vaginal smear analyses were performed and ER (estrogen receptor alpha) and CYP19 (cytochrome P450 aromatase) levels in the endometriotic lesions were analysed morphologically and immunohistochemically.The clotrimazole group presented a reduction in serum estrogen levels, which were not influenced by the estrous cycle of the animals.The expression of ER and CYP19 in endometriotic lesions was also reduced in the clotrimazole group compared to the control group.Moreover, clotrimazole treatment decreased the size of the lesions, as confirmed by histological examination, which showed glandular atrophy for both routes of administration.These results suggest that clotrimazole interferes with the estrogen production pathway by downregulating CYP19 and, therefore, reducing serum estrogen levels.Thus, the drug decreases endometriotic lesion size and consequently disease progression. Microscopic granulosa cell proliferations are rare incidental findings in ovarian and extraovarian tissue, and can simulate granulosa cell tumors.We report a case of a 22-yr-old nulliparous woman with incidental microscopic granulosa cell proliferation in the wall of an endometriotic cyst.Excision of the cyst revealed extensive endometriosis and incidental microscopic nests and cords of granulosa cells measuring 1.5 mm and positive for inhibin A and calretinin.A rare Call-Exner body was noted.An extensive literature review of both ovarian and extraovarian granulosa cell proliferations were performed to determine their possible origin, variable morphologic features and differential diagnosis.Forty-seven cases were identified occurring in pregnant (26%) and nonpregnant (74%) settings.The nonpregnant cases reveal an association with endometriosis and endometrioid adenocarcinomas.Follow-up data is very limited, but no reports of subsequent granulosa cell tumors are reported.We hypothesize that possible anovulation may play a role in the development of these proliferations.Because of unknown pathogenesis and limited follow-up data being available, their clinical significance and risk of neoplasia remain unclear. Endometriosis is a common and challenging condition of reproductive-aged women that is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity.Despite its prevalence, there is still no effective therapeutics; so we aim to evaluate the ellagic acid (EA) effect on the most relevant aspects that are known to be altered in endometriosis.Endometrial primary cultures from women with and without endometriosis and endometrial cell lines were incubated with EA (50 and 100 M) for 24 and 48 h. The results demonstrated that EA arrests an endometrial stromal cell cycle on the G2/M phase, after 48 h. In addition, 100 M EA treatment significantly decreased ECC-1 cell migration at 20 h and T-HESC cell migration at 10 h and 20 h, while 50 M EA significantly decreased T-HESC cell migration at 20 h. On the other hand, we proved that the treatment with EA for 24 h reduces T-HESC and ECC-1 adhesion to plastic.However, we did not find an effect of EA on cell proliferation.EA has an inhibitory effect on endometrial cell adhesion, migration and cell cycle progression in vitro.These highlight the idea to investigate natural compounds as novel and promising candidates for therapeutic treatment of endometriosis. Obesity and endometriosis are two very common entities, yet there is uncertainty on their exact relationship.Observational studies have repeatedly shown an inverse correlation between endometriosis and a low body mass index (BMI).However, obesity does not protect against endometriosis and on the contrary an increased BMI may lead to more severe forms of the disease.Besides, BMI is not accurate in all cases of obesity.Consequently, other anthropometric and phenomic traits have been studied, including body adiposity content, as well as the effect of BMI early in life on the manifestation of endometriosis in adulthood.Some studies have shown that the phenotypic inverse correlation between the two entities has a genetic background; however, others have indicated that certain polymorphisms are linked with endometriosis in females with increased BMI.The advent of metabolic bariatric surgery and pertinent research have led to the emergence of biomolecules that may be pivotal in understanding the pathophysiological interaction of the two entities, especially in the context of angiogenesis and inflammation.Future research should focus on three objectives: detection and interpretation of obesity-related biomarkers in experimental models with endometriosis; integration of endometriosis-related queries into bariatric registries; and multidisciplinary approach and collaboration among specialists.  Endometriosis is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of normal endometrial mucosa abnormally implanted in locations other than the uterine cavity.Endometriosis can be either endopelvic or extrapelvic depending on the location of endometrial tissue implantation.Despite the rarity of extrapelvic endometriosis, several cases of endometriosis of the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary tract, the upper and lower respiratory system, the diaphragm, the pleura and the pericardium, as well as abdominal scars loci have been reported in the literature.There are several theories about the pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of endometriosis.Depending on the place of endometrial tissue implantation, endometriosis can be expressed with a wide variety of symptoms.The diagnosis of this entity is neither easy nor routine.Many diagnostic methods clinical and laboratory have been used, but none of them is the golden standard.The multipotent localization of endometriosis in combination with the wide range of its clinical expression should raise the clinical suspicion in every woman with periodic symptoms of extrapelvic organs.Finally, the therapeutic approach of this clinical entity is also correlated with the bulk of endometriosis and the locum that it is found.It varies from simple observation, to surgical treatment and treatment with medication as well as a combination of those.Virtual slides: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1968087883113362.  Endometriosis is estrogen-dependent disorder.Two theories provide the explanations for the increased estrogen production.One is the feed-forward loop model linking inflammation and estrogen production.The more recent model evokes the tissue hypoxia resulting from endometrial debris detached and then regurgitated to the peritoneal cavity.Both models tacitly assume that everything occurs within the endometriotic stromal cells, seemingly without the need for exogenous factors.This study was undertaken to investigate as whether platelets may be responsible for local estrogen overproduction.We employed in vitro experimentation that evaluated the 17-estradiol (E2) levels in endometriotic stromal cells treated with activated platelets, and the genes and protein expression levels of StAR, HSD3B2, aromatase, and HSD17B1, as well as their upstream genes/proteins such as NF-B, TGF-1, HIF-1, SF-1 and phosphorylated CREB.In addition, we conducted 2 animal experimentations using platelet depletion/infusion and also neutralization of NF-B and TGF-1, followed by immunohistochemistry analysis of involved in StAR, HSD3B2, aromatase, and HSD17B1, as well as SF-1 and p-CREB.We found that treatment of endometriotic stromal cells by activated platelets increase the E2 production by 4.5 fold, and concomitant with increased gene and protein expression of StAR, HSD3B2, aromatase, and HSD17B1, the four genes/enzymes important to estrogen synthesis, along with their upstream genes HIF-1, SF-1 and phosphorylated CREB.Moreover, platelets activate these genes through the activation of NF-B and/or TGF-1, and antagonism of either signaling pathway can abolish the induction of the 4 genes and thus increased estrogen production.The two animal experimentations confirmed these changes.Thus, platelets increase the E2 production in endometriotic stromal cells through upregulation of StAR, HSD3B2, aromatase, and HSD17B1 via the activation of NF-B and/or TGF-1.These findings provide a yet another compelling piece of evidence that endometriotic lesions are indeed wounds undergoing repeated tissue injury and repair.They strongly indicate that non-hormonal therapeutics for endometriosis is theoretically viable, with anti-platelet therapy being one promising avenue. Endosalpingiosis, traditionally regarded as an incidental pathological finding, was recently reported to have an association with gynecologic malignancies.To determine the prevalence of endosalpingiosis, we evaluated all benign appearing adnexal lesions using the Sectioning and Extensively Examining-Fimbria (SEE-Fim) protocol, and queried the pathology database for the presence of endosalpingiosis, gynecologic malignancy, endometriosis, Walthard nests, and paratubal cysts.Using the SEE-Fim protocol, the prevalence of endosalpingiosis, endometriosis, Walthard nests, and paratubal cysts were 22%, 45%, 33%, and 42% respectively, substantially higher than previously reported.All lesions were observed to increase with age except endometriosis which increased until menopause then decreased dramatically.Among specimens including ovarian tissue, the prevalence of implantation of at least one lesion type was ubiquitous in patients age 51 and older (93%).The clinical significance of endosalpingiosis should be a continued area of research with larger trials assessing prevalence, factors affecting incidence, and association with malignancy.Our findings contribute to elucidating the origin of ectopic lesions and gynecologic disease risk. Evidence from observational studies indicates that endometriosis and depression often co-occur.However, conflicting evidence exists, and the etiology as well as biological mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain unknown.Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we comprehensively assessed the relationship between endometriosis and depression.Single nucleotide polymorphism effect concordance analysis (SECA) found a significant genetic overlap between endometriosis and depression (PFsig-permuted = 9.99 10-4).Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analysis estimated a positive and highly significant genetic correlation between the two traits (rG = 0.27, P = 8.85 10-27).A meta-analysis of endometriosis and depression GWAS (sample size = 709,111), identified 20 independent genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 10-8), of which eight are novel.Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) suggests a causal effect of depression on endometriosis.Combining gene-based association results across endometriosis and depression GWAS, we identified 22 genes with a genome-wide significant Fishers combined P value (FCPgene < 2.75 10-6).Genes with a nominal gene-based association (Pgene < 0.05) were significantly enriched across endometriosis and depression (Pbinomial-test = 2.90 10-4).Also, genes overlapping the two traits at Pgene < 0.1 (Pbinomial-test = 1.31 10-5) were significantly enriched for the biological pathways cell-cell adhesion, inositol phosphate metabolism, Hippo-Merlin signaling dysregulation and gastric mucosa abnormality.These results reveal a shared genetic etiology for endometriosis and depression.Indeed, additional analyses found evidence of a causal association between each of endometriosis and depression and at least one abnormal condition of gastric mucosa.Our study confirms the comorbidity of endometriosis and depression, implicates links with gastric mucosa abnormalities in their causal pathways and reveals potential therapeutic targets for further investigation. The clinical pharmacology of elagolix was extensively evaluated in clinical studies in healthy subjects and in women with endometriosis.Elagolix pharmacokinetics (PK) show significant population variability, however they are minimally affected by patients baseline characteristics and demographics, except for clinically relevant extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as coadministrated strong organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 inhibitors and severe hepatic impairment, which are contraindications for the use of elagolix.These studies enabled a comprehensive understanding of elagolix mechanism of action and the downstream pharmacodynamic (PD) effects on gonadotropin and ovarian hormones, as well as full characterization of the PK/PD (PKPD) relationships of elagolix at various dosages, including the approved 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily dosing regimens for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.Several model-based analyses have contributed to understanding of the benefit-risk profile of elagolix in patients with endometriosis, through characterization of the exposure relationship with responder rates, with changes in bone mineral density over time, as well as the interaction with coadministered drugs.Collectively, these studies and analyses served as supportive evidence for the effectiveness of the approved dosages and provided general dosing instructions of the first approved oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist. Endometriosis is a prevalent chronic disease that affects approximately 6% to 10% of reproductive-aged women.Although numerous researchers have endeavored to explore the etiology of endometriosis over a century, its etiology still remains an enigma.The exploration of pathophysiologic mechanism and novel therapy for endometriosis depends on ideal endometriotic models.In the previous decade, various endometriotic models have been established; therefore, we made a conclusion for available information on these models.This review summarized the common experimental models used in endometriotic studies, including their origins, characteristics, applications, and limitations.Endometriotic models played an important role in studying etiologies and novel treatments of endometriosis during the last decades.Among them, animal models and endometriotic cell lines were viewed as most common studying tools to explore the intrinsic entities of endometriosis.In addition, endometrial organoid also emerged and was regarded as an ideal studying tool for endometriosis research.Different research models collectively complement each other to advance the endometriosis research.The successful establishment of endometrial organoids means that organoids are expected to become an ideal model for studying endometriosis in the future. Follicular fluid (FF) surrounds the granulosa cell-oocyte complex and is one of the mediating factors in the communication between the cells within the follicle.Literature reveals that human FF and its components are key factors to the success of natural fertilization.Among other substances, FF consists of multiple cytokines and immune cells, including interleukin 6 (IL6), IL12, sHLA-G, macrophages, NK cells and lymphocytes.Together, these cells and cytokines might influence the oocyte-granulosa-cell complex.Altered balances of immune content might be involved in changes on folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation, oocyte quality and ovulation.Furthermore, these altered balances are possibly involved in infertility associated with immune-mediated diseases such as endometriosis.The aim of this narrative review is to elaborate on the function and contents of FF and its immunological profile in patients with endometriosis.A comprehensive literature search was performed for the published literature on FF (immune) contents, FF function and FF content alterations in endometriosis patients.In FF of patients with endometriosis, elevated levels of macrophages and several cytokines have been reported.The role of specific immune cells in FF and a clarification of the biological mechanism in healthy women and endometriosis patients remain largely unknown.Future studies in this field will give us more insight in the role of FF immune cells and the effect of altered balances in patients with endometriosis. Ovarian carcinoma with a somatically derived yolk sac tumor component is a phenomenon known to mostly occur in postmenopausal women.Herein, we report an ovarian endometriosis-associated somatic yolk sac tumor arising in the background of a low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma in a young woman.A 27-yr-old woman presented with abdominal pain, subsequently recognized to be caused by a right ovarian mass undergoing torsion.Following operative management, microscopic examination of the salpingo-oophorectomy specimen showed endometriosis and a predominantly cystic ovarian neoplasm with 2 distinct phenotypic areas: (1) a yolk sac tumor component containing Schiller-Duval bodies and (2) a low-grade endometrioid carcinoma component with squamous metaplasia.Immunohistochemical evaluation showed distinct profiles in the yolk sac tumor (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/PAX8 negative, SALL4/Glypican 3 positive) and endometrioid (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/PAX8 positive, SALL4/Glypican 3 negative) components.Given these findings, the diagnosis of an endometriosis-associated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a somatically derived yolk sac tumor was rendered.The tumor was staged as pT1c1 due to intraoperative spillage.The patient underwent chemotherapeutic treatment and after 15 mo of follow-up, she was alive with no evidence of recurrence.This example demonstrates that somatic yolk sac tumor differentiation in ovarian epithelial neoplasia can occur in young patients; awareness of this phenomenon is important as somatic and germ cell yolk sac neoplasia have different behavior and therapy. The 2019 meeting of the Society for Reproductive Biology (SRB) provided a platform for the dissemination of new knowledge and innovations to improve reproductive health in humans, enhance animal breeding efficiency and understand the effect of the environment on reproductive processes.The effects of environment and lifestyle on fertility and animal behaviour are emerging as the most important modern issues facing reproductive health.Here, we summarise key highlights from recent work on endocrine-disrupting chemicals and diet- and lifestyle-induced metabolic changes and how these factors affect reproduction.This is particularly important to discuss in the context of potential effects on the reproductive potential that may be imparted to future generations of humans and animals.In addition to key summaries of new work in the male and female reproductive tract and on the health of the placenta, for the first time the SRB meeting included a workshop on endometriosis.This was an important opportunity for researchers, healthcare professionals and patient advocates to unite and provide critical updates on efforts to reduce the effect of this chronic disease and to improve the welfare of the women it affects.These new findings and directions are captured in this review. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) are responsible for the pathogenesis of endometriosis (Ems), which is characterized by the presence of functional endometriallike tissues outside the uterine cavity.Abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in ESCs may be implicated in the etiology of Ems; however, the exact mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of miRNAs on ESCs and the underlying mechanisms.Using a microarray assay, microRNA16 (miR16) was found to be significantly downregulated in the ectopic endometrial tissues in patients with Ems, compared with that in eutopic endometrial tissues.Overexpression of miR16 significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of ESCs, whereas miR16 inhibition exerted the opposite effects.Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR16 directly targeted the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)B kinase subunit (IKK) and suppressed its translation.It was observed that the expression of IKK was upregulated and inversely correlated with miR16 levels in the ectopic endometrial tissues in patients with Ems.Additionally, knockdown of IKK by siIKK mimicked the effects of miR16 overexpression on ESCs, while the promoting effects of IKK overexpression on the migration and invasion of ESCs were attenuated by miR16 overexpression.Finally, miR16 inhibited the activation of the NFB pathway by targeting IKK.Collectively, these results demonstrated that miR16 may suppress Ems by inhibiting the IKK/NFB pathway, suggesting that miR16 may be a useful target in the treatment of Ems. Programmed cellular responses to cycling ovarian-derived steroid hormones are central to normal endometrial function.Abnormalities therein, as in the estrogen-dependent, progesterone-"resistant" disorder, endometriosis, predispose to infertility and poor pregnancy outcomes.The endometrial stromal fibroblast (eSF) is a master regulator of pregnancy success.However, the complex hormone-epigenome-transcriptome interplay in eSF by each individual steroid hormone, estradiol (E2) and/or progesterone (P4), under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions, is poorly understood and was investigated herein.Genome-wide analysis in normal, early and late stage eutopic eSF revealed: i) In contrast to P4, E2 extensively affected the eSF DNA methylome and transcriptome.Importantly, E2 resulted in a more open versus closed chromatin, confirmed by histone modification analysis.Combined E2 with P4 affected a totally different landscape than E2 or P4 alone.ii) P4 responses were aberrant in early and late stage endometriosis, and mapping differentially methylated CpG sites with progesterone receptor targets from the literature revealed different but not decreased P4-targets, leading to question the P4-"resistant" phenotype in endometriosis.Interestingly, an aberrant E2-response was noted in eSF from endometriosis women; iii) Steroid hormones affected specific genomic contexts and locations, significantly enriching enhancers and intergenic regions and minimally involving proximal promoters and CpG islands, regardless of hormone type and eSF disease state.iv) In eSF from women with endometriosis, aberrant hormone-induced methylation signatures were mainly due to existing DNA methylation marks prior to hormone treatments and involved known endometriosis genes and pathways.v) Distinct DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures revealed early and late stage endometriosis comprise unique disease subtypes.Taken together, the data herein, for the first time, provide significant insight into the hormone-epigenome-transcriptome interplay of each steroid hormone in normal eSF, and aberrant E2 response, distinct disease subtypes, and pre-existing epigenetic aberrancies in the setting of endometriosis, provide mechanistic insights into how endometriosis affects endometrial function/dysfunction. ARID1A loss-of-function mutation accompanied by a loss of ARID1A protein expression is considered one of the most important driver events in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer.Although our recent genomic study clarified that ARID1A loss-of-function mutations were detected in 13% of ovarian endometriosis, an association between the ARID1A mutation status and ARID1A protein expression in ovarian endometriosis remains unclear.We performed immunohistochemical staining for ARID1A in 78 ovarian endometriosis samples and 99 clear cell carcinoma samples.We revealed that not only 70 endometriosis samples without ARID1A mutations but also eight endometriosis samples with ARID1A loss-of-function mutations retained ARID1A protein expression.On the other hand, most of clear cell carcinomas with ARID1A loss-of-function mutations showed a loss of ARID1A protein expression.In particular, clear cell carcinoma samples which harbor multiple ARID1A loss-of-function mutations or both a single ARID1A loss-of-function mutation and ARID1A allelic imbalance lost ARID1A protein expression.However, ARID1A protein expression was retained in seven clear cell carcinomas with ARID1A loss-of-function mutations.These results suggest that a single ARID1A loss-of-function mutation is insufficient for ARID1A loss in ovarian endometriosis and some clear cell carcinoma.Further driver events may be needed for the malignant transformation of ovarian endometriosis with ARID1A loss-of-function mutations. Endometriosis is a common gynaecological disease of women in reproductive age, and is thought to arise from retrograde menstruation and implantation of endometrial tissue, mostly into the peritoneal cavity.The condition is characterized by a chronic, unresolved inflammatory process thereby contributing to pain as cardinal symptom in endometriosis.Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress have been postulated as factors in endometriosis pathogenesis.We here set out for a systematic study to identify novel mechanisms and pathways relating to oxidative stress in ectopic peritoneal lesions.Using combined proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identified novel targets including upregulated pro-oxidative enzymes, such as amine oxidase 3/vascular adhesion protein 1 (AOC3/VAP1) as well as downregulated protective factors, in particular alkenal reductase PTGR1 and methionine sulfoxide reductase.Consistent with an altered ROS landscape, we observed hemoglobin / iron overload, ROS production and lipid peroxidation in ectopic lesions.ROS-derived 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal induced interleukin IL-8 release from monocytes.Notably, AOC3 inhibitors provoked analgesic effects in inflammatory pain models in vivo, suggesting potential translational applicability. Although N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA; also known as anandamide) is present in human follicular fluid (FF), its regulation remains unknown.Therefore, the aims of the present study were to: (1) investigate the relationships between FF AEA concentrations in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology and their age, body mass index, ART characteristics and fertility treatment outcomes; and (2) assess how different inflammatory patterns may trigger AEA production by human granulosa cells (hGCs).FF AEA concentrations were higher in women undergoing IVF than in those undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection group.FF AEA median concentrations were lower in women undergoing ART because of male factor infertility than in women with endometriosis (1.6 vs 2.5nM respectively), but not women with tubal, hormonal or unexplained infertility (1.6, 2.4 and 1.9nM respectively).To evaluate the effects of macrophages on AEA production by hGCs, hGCs were cocultured with monocyte-derived macrophages.The conditioned medium from M1 polarised macrophages increased AEA production by hGCs.This was accompanied by an increase in AEA-metabolising enzymes, particularly N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D. The results of the present study show that high FF AEA concentrations in patients with endometriosis may be associated with the recruitment of inflammatory chemokines within the ovary, which together may contribute to the decreased reproductive potential of women with endometriosis.Collectively, these findings add a new player to the hormone and cytokine networks that regulate fertility in women. The purpose of this review was to systematize the data on the effect of endometriosis on the fertility index, the course of pregnancy, and the modern diagnosis of changes the endometriotic implants during pregnancy.There are many factors that can potentially affect fertility in patients with endometriosis: anatomical changes in the pelvic floor, impaired transport function of the fallopian tubes due to the formation of adhesions, impaired steroid and folliculogenesis, anovulation and peritoneal changes that contribute to the formation of a harmful prooxidant microenvironment, which can affect the quality and quantity of oocytes and cause a violation of the susceptibility of the endometrium.If the patient with endometriosis still managed to get pregnant, then the problem of maintaining this pregnancy arises even more.The data indicate that pregnancy has a positive effect on the symptoms of endometriosis, and also has a beneficial effect on the growth rate and relapse rate of endometriosis, and may also cause a regression of the formed endometriotic implants.However, data on the effect of pregnancy on endometriosis are contradictory, and pregnancy in women with endometriosis does not always lead to the disappearance of symptoms and a decrease in the size of endometrioid lesions.Moreover, there is growing evidence that endometriosis can affect pregnancy outcomes.Currently, it is impossible to predict changes in the endometriotic implants due to insufficient knowledge about the pathogenesis of this disease.A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis should help prevent hasty obstetric decisions that can lead to iatrogenic diseases in newborns, and patients should be informed about possible complications during pregnancy when planning a birth.  Endometriosis is among the most common benign gynecological conditions, and it affects 6-15% of women of reproductive.During recent decades, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and especially laparoscopy, have gained significant ground concerning the treatment of gynecological disorders.To date, laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.Available English-language papers in PubMed and Scopus databases have been used for the current narrative review.Data from all relevant literature regarding single-port laparoscopy and treatment of endometriosis have been extracted.The main key words used by the authors for the search were: single-port laparoscopy, endometriosis and laparoscopy.Two authors (A.D. and K.C.)performed the data base search and extraction of relevant studies, and a third author (E.A.)consented to the study selection of the 23 relevant papers, consulted and approved the final presentation of the results and conclusions.To date, the laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) technique has been used for a variety of procedures in gynecology as well as for a variety of diagnoses.Thus, adhesiolysis, ovarian endometrioma enucleation and salpingo-oophorectomy can be easily performed using the LESS approach.Novel single-site trocars as well as appropriate curved instruments are being designed and produced to facilitate the surgeon utilizing such a demanding technique.However, single-site surgery does not seem to have a place to date in the treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis due to the complicated surgical maneuvers required for the treatment of this condition combined with technical difficulties posed by the loss of triangulation, and the instrument crowding when LESS is implemented.Apart from being feasible, LESS has also proven to be non-inferior in terms of surgical safety and efficacy, and according to most, but not all, reports, better in terms of cosmetics and postoperative body image perception.Currently, it has been shown that most of the gynecologic operations are feasible using the LESS approach.So, this approach has a role to play in the treatment of endometriosis too, especially concerning the most common manifestations of the disease.However, more extensive research is required to properly evaluate single-port access techniques to conventional minimally invasive ones in the treatment of the different manifestations of endometriosis, concerning short term as well as long term outcomes of the treatment, including the ones associated to fertility.  Endometriosis is a common inflammatory estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder, associated with pelvic pain and reduced fertility in women.Several aspects of this disorder and its cellular and molecular etiology remain unresolved.We have analyzed the global gene expression patterns in the endometrium, peritoneum and in endometriosis lesions of endometriosis patients and in the endometrium and peritoneum of healthy women.In this report, we present the EndometDB, an interactive web-based user interface for browsing the gene expression database of collected samples without the need for computational skills.The EndometDB incorporates the expression data from 115 patients and 53 controls, with over 24000 genes and clinical features, such as their age, disease stages, hormonal medication, menstrual cycle phase, and the different endometriosis lesion types.Using the web-tool, the end-user can easily generate various plot outputs and projections, including boxplots, and heatmaps and the generated outputs can be downloaded in pdf-format.Availability and implementationThe web-based user interface is implemented using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Plotly and R. It is freely available from https://endometdb.utu.fi/ . In endometriosis, M2 Ms are dominant in endometriotic lesions, but the actual role of M2 M is unclear.CD206 positive (+) M is classified in one of M2 type Ms and are known to produce cytokines and chemokines.In the present study, we used CD206 diphtheria toxin receptor mice, which enable to deplete CD206+ cells with diphtheria toxin (DT) in an endometriosis mouse model.The depletion of CD206+ M decreased the total weight of endometriotic-like lesions significantly (p < 0.05).In the endometriotic-like lesions in the DT group, a lower proliferation of endometriotic cells and the decrease of angiogenesis were observed.In the lesions, the mRNA levels of VEGFA and TGF1, angiogenic factors, in the DT group significantly decreased to approximately 50% and 30% of control, respectively.Immunohistochemical study revealed the expressions of VEGFA and an endothelial cell marker CD31 in lesions of the DT group, were dim compared to those in control.Also, the number of TGF1 expressing M was significantly reduced compared to control.These data suggest that CD206+ M promotes the formation of endometriotic-like lesions by inducing angiogenesis around the lesions. Endometriosis is a common and benign gynecological disorder but exhibits malignant features.However, the underlying pathogenesis and pathophysiology of endometriosis remain unclear.Circular RNAs have been demonstrated to participate in the occurrence and progression of multiple diseases.This study was aimed to explore the roles of circATRNL1 in endometriosis in vitro.Based on the results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, we found significant upregulation of circATRNL1 and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), while downregulation of miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p in ectopic tissues compared to eutopic tissues.The immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed differentially expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers between EuEM and EcEM tissues.The in vitro assays indicated that overexpression of circATRNL1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Ishikawa cells, and induce EMT process, while circATRNL1 silencing showed the opposite effect.The mechanical investigation indicated that circATRNL1 upregulated YAP1 by sponging miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p.Gain-of-function assays validated the inhibitory function of miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p in endometriosis.The results of rescue assays confirmed the function of circATRNL1-miR-141-3p/miR-200a-3p-YAP1 axis on Ishikawa cells.Our findings demonstrate that abnormal upregulation of circATRNL1 regulates cell proliferation and motility and promotes EMT process via the miR-141-3p/miR-200a-3p-YAP1 axis in vitro, which could contribute to the progression of endometriosis. The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of conservative surgery with or without adjunctive presacral neurectomy (PN) for chronic endometriosis-related pelvic pain.In a systematic review with meta-analysis, randomized or nonrandomized controlled studies of conservative endometriosis surgery with or without adjunctive PN were included.Main outcomes were treatment failure (the proportion of women in which surgery failed to adequately resolve midline pain) and the frequency of operative and postoperative complications.A total of 7 studies with 8 group comparisons (3 randomized) representing 503 women (250 PN; 253 Control) were included.Over 34 months median follow-up, crude rates of treatment failure were 15.0% with PN and 40.9% with Controls (risk ratio = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.60, p < 0.001).The risk of postoperative constipation was higher with PN vs. Controls (12.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.024).No treatment group differences were observed for the risk of operative complications (0.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.498), reoperation (4.1% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.758) or urinary incontinence (5.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.195).Overall, in well-selected patients, conservative surgery with adjunctive PN may provide greater relief from midline pain and a similarly low rate of operative complications relative to conservative surgery alone but may increase the risk of constipation postoperatively.However, results were derived from mainly older and lower quality studies.Since then, surgical techniques to treat endometriosis have been improved and the effect of PN observed in prior studies should be confirmed in future studies in women in whom radical excision of deep infiltrating lesions is obtained. Pelvic mass onset following a hysterectomy due to benign disease is not rarely seen.Appropriate diagnosis and treatment are of great importance.This study aims to analyze the clinicopathological features of patients who have received surgery for pelvic mass following hysterectomy due to gynecological benign disease, especially endometriosis or adenomyosis.This study retrospectively analyzed the patients undergone reoperation for pelvic mass subsequently to hysterectomy from January 2012 to December 2016 in a tertiary teaching hospital.A total of 247 patients were enrolled in this study.There is a significant difference between the patients with or without a history of endometriosis/adenomyosis.Multivariate analysis showed that the pelvic mass had a higher risk of being ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, ovarian clear cell carcinoma, ovarian endometriosis, and ovarian physiological cysts in patients with a history of adenomyosis/endometriosis.The pathology of the subsequent pelvic mass inclines to be benign, includes ovarian endometriosis, ovarian physiological cysts, and pelvic encapsulated effusion.Postoperative adjuvant therapy for those received hysterectomy due to endometriosis/adenomyosis, like gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), may contribute to the prevention of benign pelvic mass.Patients with a history of hysterectomy due to endometrisos/adenomyosis tend to have a shorter time interval between hysterectomy and pelvic malignant tumors onset. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis by modulating the proliferation and invasion of ectopic endometrial cells in vitro, but related in vivo studies are rare.This study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA H19 in a nude mouse model of endometriosis.Ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ecESCs) were isolated from ectopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis and infected with lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) negative control (LV-NC-shRNA) or lncRNA-H19 shRNA (LV-H19-shRNA).The ecESCs infected with LV-NC-shRNA and LV-H19-shRNA were subcutaneously implanted into forty 6- to 8-week-old female nude mice.The size and weight of the endometriotic implants were measured at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after implantation and compared, and lncRNA H19 levels in endometriotic implants were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).All nude mice survived the experimental period, and no significant differences in body weight were observed between the experimental group and the control group.All nude mice developed histologically confirmed subcutaneous endometriotic lesions with glandular structures and stroma after 1 week of implantation.The subcutaneous lesions in the LV-NC-shRNA group after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of implantation were larger than those in the LV-H19-shRNA group, and lncRNA H19 levels in subcutaneous lesions in the LV-NC-shRNA group were significantly higher than those in the LV-H19-shRNA group.Knockdown of lncRNA H19 suppresses endometriosis in vivo.Further study is required to explore the underlying mechanism in the future.  In women suffering from endometriosis and infertility, the decision as to when and how to perform surgical excision and/or fertility treatment is mainly based on clinical guidelines and expert opinions.However, so far data from randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses to answer the question whether surgical treatment of moderate to severe endometriosis can indeed enhance pregnancy rates compared with expectant management are lacking, as not all studies report fertility outcome or supply sufficiently detailed information.The most frequently used staging system for endometriosis is the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) score (ASRM, 1997).Unfortunately, this classification system has some serious limitations, including not effectively predicting clinical outcomes of treatment, especially pregnancy rates in infertile patients.For this reason, Adamson and Pasta (2010) developed the endometriosis fertility index (EFI).EFI is a scoring system which includes assessment of historical factors at the time of surgery (age, duration of infertility and pregnancy history), of adnexal function at conclusion of surgery (functional score of Fallopian tubes, fimbriae and ovaries bilaterally), and of the extensiveness of endometriosis (rAFS endometriosis lesion score and total rAFS score).The EFI is intended as a clinical tool to counsel patients on the approach towards fertility after surgery.  Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory and estrogen-dependent disease affecting about 10 % of the female population in fertile ages.There is no cure for endometriosis.The main symptoms include severe menstrual pain, ovulation pain, dyspareunia, dysuria and painful bowel movements.Endometriosis is associated with infertility.Endometriosis affects every day life with pain and fatigue and a negative impact on education, career, social life and quality of life.Endometriosis can emerge at the first menstruations and also continue to give symptoms after menopause.The symptoms can vary greatly between individuals and also during life.The pathofysiology is unknown but the most accepted theory is retrograde menstruation where endometrial cells implant into the peritoneum affecting different abdominal organs.The immune system fails to clear the endometrial cells which results in endometriotic lesions that might cause inflammation, pain and adhesions.The treatment includes hormone treatment, surgical treatment, pain medication, physiotherapy, counseling and sometimes multi-disciplinary pain rehabilitation.It is important to increase the knowledge of this common disease both among the public and health professionals since early treatment is of great importance to reduce the risk for chronic pain and severe effects on quality of life.We hope that the recently published clinical guidelines will result in better and more equal care for patients with endometriosis in Sweden. Oxidative stress in the follicular fluid (FF) is thought to be responsible for the abnormal development of oocytes.In our study patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and tubal infertility factor (TIF), and healthy women with a male factor of infertility, were prospectively enrolled.From each patient, a sample of individual FF was collected from a dominant follicle.Concentration levels of TAS, 8-IP, 8-OHdG, and AMH were determined.In women with PCOS, we found significantly lower values of oxidative stress markers in the FF.8-IP and TAS levels were lower in the FF of women with endometriosis.In women with TIF, we also found significantly lower values of all tested markers in the FF, except for 8-OHdG and AMH.We wanted to see whether the biomarker measured in the FF in an individual diagnosis could predict a successfully obtained embryo from this particular follicle.The FF 8-OHdG result in PCOS patients stood out and proved to be a good predictive marker of matured and fertilized oocytes in these patients.Further research is needed to be able to apply the acquired knowledge in improving the outcome of IVF procedures. Endometriosis are characterized by dense fibrous tissue.Numerous studies have investigated roles of inflammation on the pathophysiology of endometriosis.However, the interplay of inflammation and fibrosis remains to be clarified.Here we show that low levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) promoted a fibrotic phenotype, whereas high levels of IL-1 and TNF inactivated the fibrotic phenotype of endometriotic stromal cells (Ectopic-ES).IL-1 10 pg/mL and TNF 100 and 1,000 pg/mL had minimal effects, whereas the highest dose of IL-1 (100 pg/mL) significantly decreased collagen gel contraction in Ectopic-ES.Furthermore, in Ectopic-ES, low levels of IL-1 (1 pg/mL) and/or TNF 10 pg/mL significantly increased Col I mRNA expression, whereas higher doses of IL-1 (10 and/or 100 pg/mL) and/or TNF (100 and/or 1,000 pg/mL) significantly decreased Col I and/or SMA mRNA expression and the percentage of cells with Col I + and/or SMA + stress fibers.In contrast, in either menstrual endometrial stromal cells of patients with endometriosis or those of healthy women, varying doses of IL-1 and/or TNF had no significant effects on either Col I or SMA mRNA/protein expression.The present findings bring into question whether we should still continue to attempt anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for endometriosis. Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers (EAOCs) including endometrioid and clear cell ovarian carcinoma are subgroups of epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs), which is generally acknowledged as the most lethal gynecological malignancy.Endometriosis (ES), a common clinical disease among women, presents with clinical symptoms of pelvic pain, infertility, or adnexal masses with the formation of endometrioma.It has long been considered to be a potential risk factor for developing EOCs, mainly of endometrioid and clear cell subtypes.Here, we compiled data from previous researches on deregulated molecular functions among ES and EOCs using gene set-based integrative analysis to decipher molecular and genetic relationships between ovarian ES and EOCs, especially EAOCs.We conclude that epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)-related pathways are important in the carcinogenesis of type I EOCs, including clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous ovarian carcinoma.Dysfunctional molecular pathways, such as deregulated oxidoreductase activity, metabolism, hormone activity, inflammatory response, innate immune response, and cell-cell signaling, played key roles in the malignant transformation of EAOCs.Nine genes related to inflammasome complex and inflammasome-related pathway were identified, indicating the importance of inflammation/immunity in EAOC transformation.We also collect progressive treatments of EAOC focused on targeted therapies and immunotherapy so far.This summarized information can contribute toward effective detection and treatment of EAOCs in the future. Adenomyosis represents a unique pathophysiological condition in which normal-appearing endometrial mucosa resides within myometrium and is thus protected from menstrual shedding.The resulting ectopic presence of endometrial tissue composed of glands and stroma is thought to affect normal contractile function and peristalsis of uterine smooth muscle, causing menometrorrhagia, infertility, and adverse obstetric outcomes.Since the first description of adenomyosis more than 150 years ago, pathologists have studied this lesion by examining tissue specimens, and have proposed multiple explanations to account for its pathogenesis.However, as compared with endometriosis, progress of adenomyosis research has been, at best, incremental mainly due to the lack of standardized protocols in sampling tissue and a lack of consensus diagnostic criteria in pathology practice.Despite these limitations, recent advances in revealing the detailed anatomy and biology of eutopic endometrium offer an unprecedented opportunity to study this common but relatively understudied disorder.Here, we briefly summarize the pathological aspects of adenomyosis from an historical background, and discuss conventional morphology and recent tissue-based molecular studies with a special emphasis on elucidating its tissue of origin from a pathologists perspective.We also discuss unmet needs in pathology studies that would be important for advancing adenomyosis research. Endometriosis is a disease seen in women at reproductive age, characterized by extrauterine localization of endometrial tissue.Colonic endometriosis rarely causes acute mechanical intestinal obstruction (AMIO).It may also be presented with pelvic pain, dyspareunia, tenesmus, painful defecation related to the menstrual cycle.In the literature, 3-37% of the gastrointestinal location was reported and AMIO was observed in 7-23% of these cases.There are only few cases of mechanical obstruction related to sigmoid endometriosis mimicking colon malignancy.In this study, we aim to report a case of a 40-year-old patient with AMIO developed secondary to colonic endometriosis in light of the literature.The patient was discharged with full surgical recovery after the Hartmann procedure was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was reached as endometriosis.At the post-operative sixth-month colostomy, closure and bilateral oophorectomy were performed with the patients will.The patient was discharged with surgical recovery and is still being regularly followed up.Endometriosis is a gynecological disease that may occur in all organ systems even though the most common location is the overs.Gastrointestinal located endometriosis should, therefore, be kept in mind in the etiology of AMIO in women at reproductive age and the related symptoms should be questioned in differential diagnosis. Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease in which ovarian dysfunction can be an important cause of infertility.Elevated progesterone (P4) levels during the follicular phase is possibly associated with impaired oocyte quality and pregnancy outcome in endometriosis.Beclin-1 (BECN1), an essential mediator of autophagy, has been shown to be related to the development and progression of endometriosis.This study aimed to investigate the autophagic activity in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) of patients with endometriosis and to clarify the role of BECN1 in preovulatory P4 elevation.Our results demonstrated that serum P4/estradiol (E2) ratio and P4-to-follicle index (the average P4 secretion per follicle) on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration were elevated in women with ovarian endometriosis.Increased expression of BECN1 and enhanced autophagy were observed in GCs of patients with ovarian endometriomas.In cultured GCs, BECN1 knockdown reduced P4 secretion and the expression of key steroidogenic enzymes; whereas overexpression of BECN1 resulted in induced P4 production with activated biosynthesis pathway.Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by BECN1 knockdown significantly attenuated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-induced P4 synthesis.These findings provide new insights into the role of BECN1 in late follicular P4 elevation in patients with endometriosis by promoting the degradation pathway of LDL for P4 biosynthesis via lysosome activation in GCs, and have potential therapeutic implications for the improvement of oocyte quality in women affected by endometriosis. Abnormal menstruation may result in several pathological alterations and gynaecological diseases, including endometriosis, menstrual pain and miscarriage.However, the pathogenesis of menstruation remains unclear due to the limited number of animal models available to study the menstrual cycle.In recent years, an effective, reproducible, and highly adaptive mouse model to study menstruation has been developed.In this model, progesterone and oestrogen were administered in cycles following the removal of ovaries.Subsequently, endometrial decidualisation was induced using sesame oil, followed by withdrawal of progesterone administration.Vaginal bleeding in mice is similar to that in humans.Therefore, the use of mice as a model organism to study the mechanism of menstruation and gynaecological diseases may prove to be an important breakthrough.The present review is focussed ond the development and applications of a mouse model of menstruation.Furthermore, various studies have been described to improve this model and the research findings that may aid in the treatment of menstrual disorders in women are presented. Endometriosis is a leading cause of pelvic pain and infertility.It is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue in extrauterine locations.The development of novel therapies and diagnostic tools for endometriosis has been limited due in part to challenges in studying the disease.Outside of primates, few mammals menstruate, and none develop spontaneous endometriosis.Rodent models are popular but require artificial induction of endometriosis, with many utilizing either immunocompromised mice or surgically induced disease.Recently, more attention has been given to models involving intraperitoneal injection.We present a murine model of endometriosis that integrates several features of existing endometriosis models into a novel, simplified system that relies on microscopic quantification in lieu of subjective grading.In this model, we perform hormonal stimulation of donor mice, intraperitoneal injection, systematic abdominal survey and tissue harvest, and histologic quantification that can be performed and verified at any time after necropsy.This model requires minimal resources and training; does not require expertise by lab technicians in murine survival surgery or in the identification of gross endometriotic lesions; can be used in immunocompromised, immunocompetent, and/or mutant mice; and reliably creates endometriotic lesions that are histologically consistent with human endometriotic disease. BACKGROUND Endometriosis is a unique entity described in ample literature as the decidualization of endometrial tissues under the influence of gynecological hormones outside the uterine cavity.The post-surgical presence of ectopic endometrial tissue on the skin is known as abdominal wall endometriosis, cutaneous endometriosis, or scar endometriosis.Iatrogenic implantation of detached endometrial tissues at the incision site is the most widely accepted theory for this rare monad.The unspecific scar endometriosis presentation makes it challenging to diagnose.Moreover, it can easily be confused with hematoma, hernia, lipoma, abscess, scar granuloma, and tumor.Here, we report and discuss a rare case of scar endometriosis with various available treatment modalities.CASE REPORT We delineate a case of a 39-year-old woman with abdominal wall cutaneous endometriosis.An "inverted T" incision opened the abdominal and uterine cavity as it was a problematic preterm breech in labor.After an uneventful postoperative and postpartum period, she presented with a painful, discolored nodular mass of approximately 3 cm in diameter at the left border of the cesarian scar, developed over 1.5 years, often accompanied by drainage of brownish discharge.Ultrasonography with color Doppler showed a hypoechoic lesion with internal vascularity, corroborated our preliminary diagnosis of scar endometriosis, which was further confirmed by surgical excision and histopathology.CONCLUSIONS A proper surgical resection is the standard treatment line for scar endometriosis.However, patients need regular follow-up to look for recurrences, even after treatment.Further studies are recommended to establish factors associated with cutaneous endometriosis recurrence. Endometriosis (ENDO) and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) are chronic pain conditions for which better treatments are urgently needed.Development of new therapies with proven clinical benefit has been slow.We have conducted a review of existing preclinical in vivo models for ENDO and IC/BPS in rodents, discussed to what extent they replicate the phenotype and pain experience of patients, as well as their relevance for translational research.In 1009 publications detailing ENDO models, 41% used autologous, 26% syngeneic, 18% xenograft, and 11% allogeneic tissue in transplantation models.Intraperitoneal injection of endometrial tissue was the subcategory with the highest construct validity score for translational research.From 1055 IC/BPS publications, most interventions were bladder centric (85%), followed by complex mechanisms (8%) and stress-induced models (7%).Within these categories, the most frequently used models were instillation of irritants (92%), autoimmune (43%), and water avoidance stress (39%), respectively.Notably, although pelvic pain is a hallmark of both conditions and a key endpoint for development of novel therapies, only a small proportion of the studies (models of ENDO: 0.5%-12% and models of IC/BPS: 20%-44%) examined endpoints associated with pain.Moreover, only 2% and 3% of publications using models of ENDO and IC/BPS investigated nonevoked pain endpoints.This analysis highlights the wide variety of models used, limiting reproducibility and translation of results.We recommend refining models so that they better reflect clinical reality, sharing protocols, and using standardized endpoints to improve reproducibility.We are addressing this in our project Innovative Medicines Initiative-PainCare/Translational Research in Pelvic Pain. The aim of this study was to identify the recurrence rate and risk factors for the recurrence of ovarian endometriosis (OE) after laparoscopic cystectomy.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study.Subjects were OE cases who underwent laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy at Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital (BAH).The period of this study was from January 2008 to December 2017.Ovarian histopathology and at least one-year follow-up after surgery were the prerequisite requirements.A total of 106 OE cases were included in the study.Subjects were classified into recurrence and nonrecurrence groups.It comprised of 24 and 82 cases, respectively.The mean age of the participant was 32.4 years old.The demographic characters of both groups were comparable.The recurrence rate after laparoscopic OE surgery in the present study was 22.6% (24/106).The average largest diameter of OE in the present study was 54.5 mm.Postoperative medical treatment (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.14-8.74, p = 0.02) and postoperative pregnancy (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.03-7.93, p = 0.04) were associated factors for recurrence decrement.The recurrence rate of OE after laparoscopic cystectomy was 22.6%.Postoperative medical treatment and postoperative pregnancy were a significant factor that lowered OE recurrence. Endometriosis is a common disorder of unknown etiology, and non-surgical therapies are still a challenge.To understand the pathogenesis and preclinical testing of drugs for endometriosis, animal models are highly desirous.Herein, we carried out longitudinal characterization of a mouse model for endometriosis where uterine tissue was transplanted onto the intestinal mesentery.During the course of lesion development from day 15 to 60 post-induction, the ectopic endometrium became pale, fluid-filled and the animals developed peritoneal adhesions.Most lesions resembled a well-differentiated type of endometriosis and ~13% of animals had mixed type of lesions.There was extensive stromal compaction in the ectopic tissue.During the progression of endometriosis, there was increased proliferation of epithelial and stromal cells as evident by PCNA staining.Cyp19a1 (aromatase) mRNA was detected in the ectopic lesions on day 15 and 30 post-induction of endometriosis, by day 60 the expression was reduced.As compared to the control endometrium, the mRNA levels of Esr1 progressively reduced while the levels of inflammation associated genes (Esr2, Ifng, Tnf and Il1b) increased in the ectopic lesions.Infiltration of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes was also observed in the ectopic lesions indicative of inflammation.As compared to control, there was no change in levels of Cytokeratin and E-cadherin in the epithelial cells of ectopic endometrium.We did not observe excessive collagen deposition or -SMA positive myofibroblasts in the stroma of the ectopic endometrium.Thus, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis are not detected in the mouse model of endometriosis.Our results show that the mouse model of endometriosis mimics some but not all the features of human endometriosis. Ovarian endometriosis cyst (OEC) is caused by the growth of ectopic endometrium into the ovarian cortex, leading to disrupted ovarian cortical structures and infertility.Large OECs are usually surgically removed, and assisted reproductive technology (ART) is required for future pregnancy.The oocyte reserve and development of patients with small non-surgical OECs are unknown.In this study, we compared mitochondrial abnormality, ATPase and IF1 mRNA expression levels, and OXPHO complex proteins between OEC vs control mural granulosa cells (mGCs).OEC mGCs show fewer mitochondria per cell, a higher proportion of aberrant morphology, lower ATPase mRNA levels, higher IF1 mRNA levels, and impaired expression of 3 of the 5 critical proteins involved in the OXPHOS complex, compared with control mGCs.Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cfmtDNA) levels are higher in the follicular fluid of patients with OEC and were inversely associated with the expression of mtDNA in mGCs and cumulus granulosa cells (cGCs).Taken together, this study indicates that small non-surgical OECs lead to poor quality of oocytes and subsequent embryos during ART compared with control, which was accompanied by mGC mitochondrial dysfunction.mGC and cGC mtDNA and FF cfmtDNA might serve as efficient biomarkers for the non-invasive prediction of pregnancy outcomes in patients with OEC undergoing ART. There are approximately a dozen cases of xanthogranulomatous salpingitis reported in the literature, mostly as case reports.Thirteen such cases were identified from 2003 to 2018 at our institution.Patients ages ranged from 21 to 75 yr old (median and mean, 49 yr).Clinical presentations and surgical indications included pelvic inflammatory disease (5 cases), endometrial carcinoma (4 cases), suspicion of ovarian malignancy (1 case), symptomatic fibroids (1 case), endometriosis (1 case), and infertility (1 case).Surgical-pathologic correlation resulted in diagnoses of tubo-ovarian abscess (4 cases), ovarian abscess (2 cases), pyosalpinx (2 cases), and chronic endometritis (2 cases).Of the remaining 3 cases, 2 presented clinically as pelvic inflammatory disease and the other was seen in the context of an endometrial carcinoma.In summary, this case series from a single institution shows that xanthogranulomatous salpingitis is an uncommon form of chronic inflammation that may be diagnosed from reproductive to menopausal age.With one exception, the cases in this series represent pelvic inflammatory disease despite variable clinical presentations.Pseudoxanthomatous salpingitis should be in the differential diagnosis. Endometriosis (EMS) is a disease that shows immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation characteristics, suggesting a role of complement system in its pathophysiology.To find out the hub genes and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of EMs, three raw microarray datasets were recruited from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO).Then, a series of bioinformatics technologies including gene ontology (GO), Hallmark pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and gene co-expression correlation analysis were performed to identify hub genes.The hub genes were further verified by the Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot (WB).We identified 129 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EMs, of which 78 were up-regulated and 51 were down-regulated.Through GO functional enrichment analysis, we found that the DEGs are mainly enriched in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, chemokine regulation, angiogenesis regulation, epithelial cell proliferation, et al.In Hallmark pathway enrichment analysis, coagulation pathway showed great significance and the terms in which included the central complement factors.Moreover, the genes were dominating in PPI network.Combined co-expression analysis with experimental verification, we found that the up-regulated expression of complement (C1S, C1QA, C1R, and C3) was positively related to tissue factor (TF) in EMs.In this study, we discovered the over expression complement and the positive correlation between complement and TF in EMs, which suggested that interaction of complement and coagulation system may play a role within the pathophysiology of EMS. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease, and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometriosis by promoting cell invasion.Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) plays suppressive roles in several types of tumors.However, the relationship between YAP1 and ESR2 is not fully understood.The aim of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of YAP1 in terms of ESR2 and YAP1 regulation of endometriotic stromal cell (ECSC) invasion in ovarian endometriosis.Our results demonstrated that YAP1 mRNA and protein levels in eutopic endometrium (EU) tissues were higher than those in paired ectopic endometrium (EC) tissues.ECSCs transfected with siYAP1 exhibited a significant increase in both ESR2 mRNA levels and protein expression.Simultaneously, YAP1 overexpression in ECSCs yielded the opposite results.Co-IP assays demonstrated YAP1-NuRD complex formation by YAP1, CHD4 and MTA1 in ECSCs.YAP1 bound to two sites, (-539, -533) and (-158, -152), upstream of the ESR2 transcription initiation site.YAP1 binding to the two sites of the ESR2 promoter in ECSCs was significantly lower than that in eutopic endometrial stromal cells (EUSCs) from EU tissues.ECSCs transfected with siYAP1 exhibited increased invasion activity, while ECSCs transfected with siESR2 showed inhibition of invasion.However, transfection with siYAP1 and siESR2 together decreased the number of invading cells compared with transfection with siYAP1 alone.Therefore, we conclude that decreased levels of YAP1 in ovarian endometriomas enhance ESR2 expression via formation of a YAP1-NuRD complex, which further binds to the ESR2 promoters.Furthermore, YAP1 inhibits ECSCs invasion. Endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and uterine fibroids have been proposed as endometrial cancer risk factors; however, disentangling their relationships with endometrial cancer is complicated due to shared risk factors and comorbidities.Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we explored the relationships between these non-cancerous gynecological diseases and endometrial cancer risk by assessing genetic correlation, causal relationships and shared risk loci.We found significant genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and PCOS, and uterine fibroids.Adjustment for genetically predicted body mass index (a risk factor for PCOS, uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer) substantially attenuated the genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and PCOS but did not affect the correlation with uterine fibroids.Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal relationship between only uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer.Gene-based analyses revealed risk regions shared between endometrial cancer and endometriosis, and uterine fibroids.Multi-trait GWAS analysis of endometrial cancer and the genetically correlated gynecological diseases identified a novel genome-wide significant endometrial cancer risk locus at 1p36.12, which replicated in an independent endometrial cancer dataset.Interrogation of functional genomic data at 1p36.12 revealed biologically relevant genes, including WNT4 which is necessary for the development of the female reproductive system.In summary, our study provides genetic evidence for a causal relationship between uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer.It further provides evidence that the comorbidity of endometrial cancer, PCOS and uterine fibroids may partly be due to shared genetic architecture.Notably, this shared architecture has revealed a novel genome-wide risk locus for endometrial cancer. To summarize and update our current knowledge regarding adenomyosis diagnosis, prevalence, and symptoms.Systematic review of PubMed between January 1972 and April 2020.Search strategy included: "adenomyosis [MeSH Terms] AND (endometriosis[MeSH Term OR prevalence study [MeSH Terms] OR dysmenorrhea[Text Word] OR prevalence[Text Word] OR young adults [Text Word] OR adolesce* [Text Word] OR symptoms[Text Word] OR imaging diagnosis [Text Word] OR pathology[Text Word].Articles published in English that addressed adenomyosis and discussed prevalence, diagnosis, and symptoms were included.Included articles described: pathology diagnosis, imaging, biopsy diagnosis, prevalence and age of onset, symptoms, and concomitant endometriosis.Sixteen articles were included in the qualitative analysis.The studies are heterogeneous when diagnosing adenomyosis with differing criteria, protocols, and patient populations.Prevalence estimates range from 20% to 88.8% in symptomatic women (average 30-35%) with most diagnosed between 32-38 years old.The correlation between imaging and pathology continues to evolve.As imaging advances, newer studies report younger symptomatic women are being diagnosed with adenomyosis based on both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS).High rates of concomitant endometriosis create challenges when discerning the etiology of pelvic pain.Symptoms that are historically attributed to endometriosis may actually be caused by adenomyosis.Adenomyosis remains a challenge to identify, assess and research because of the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, especially in women who wish to retain their uterus.As noninvasive diagnostics such as imaging and myometrial biopsies continue to improve, younger women with variable symptoms will likely create criteria for diagnosis with adenomyosis.The priority should be to create standardized histopathological and imaging diagnoses to gain deeper understandings of adenomyosis.  Endometriosis is the second most common benign female genital disease after uterine myoma.This review discusses the interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis.Endometriosis has been defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the internal epithelial lining of the cavum uteri.As a consequence, endometriosis can cause a wide range of symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain, subfertility, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, cyclical bowel or bladder symptoms (e.g., dyschezia, bloating, constipation, rectal bleeding, diarrhoea and hematuria), abnormal menstrual bleeding, chronic fatigue or low back pain.Approx.50 % of teenagers and up to 32 % of women of reproductive age, operated for chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhoea, suffer from endometriosis.The time interval between the first unspecific symptoms and the medical diagnosis of endometriosis is about 7 years.This is caused not only by the non-specific nature of the symptoms but also by the frequent lack of awareness on the part of the cooperating disciplines with which the patients have first contact.As the pathogenesis of endometriosis is not clearly understood, a causal treatment is still impossible.Treatment options include expectant management, analgesia, hormonal medical therapy, surgical intervention and the combination of medical treatment before and/or after surgery.The correct treatment for each patient should take into account the severity of the disease and whether the patient desires to have children.The treatment should be as radical as necessary and as minimal as possible.The recurrence rate among treated patients lies between 5 and > 60 % and is very much dependent on the integrated management and surgical skills of the respective hospital.Consequently, to optimise the individual patients treatment, a high degree of interdisciplinary cooperation in diagnosis and treatment is crucial and should, especially in the case of deep infiltrating endometriosis, be undertaken in appropriate centres.  BACKGROUND Carcinoma arising from an endometriosis-associated abdominal wall scar is a rare entity, with only a few case reports published in the literature.The management is very controversial due to on its own rarity, and there are no specific guidelines.Treatment with a multidisciplinary team is important to achieve the best outcome.CASE REPORT We report the case of a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with a growing painless lesion in the right lower quadrant.We decided to perform Tru-Cut biopsy of the abdominal wall lesion, but unfortunately the pathological report was inconclusive at that time.Due to the presence of a highly suspicious lesion, the gynecologic oncologist together with the plastic surgeon and connective tissue surgeon decided to perform a wide resection of the abdominal wall along with hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.The final pathology report demonstrated endometriosis associated with an endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade II in the abdominal wall tumor.She was restaged with new imaging exams before the definition of the best adjuvant treatment, which showed suspicious bilateral inguinal and right axillary (1.9 cm) lymph nodes, with no other sites of metastatic disease.She was treated with megestrol acetate 160 mg/daily for 8 months, with a partial response.CONCLUSIONS Carcinoma arising from an endometriosis-associated abdominal wall scar is a rare entity, and there are no no specific treatment guidelines.Such patients must be assessed by a multidisciplinary team for decision making.Options for adjuvant and palliative treatment for endometrial cancer are generally used for the treatment of this entity.The main purpose of this article is to report this rare presentation and perform a review of the literature about diagnosis, clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis. We performed genome-wide association studies of five gynecologic diseases using data of 46,837 subjects (5236 uterine fibroid, 645 endometriosis, 647 ovarian cancer (OC), 909 uterine endometrial cancer (UEC), and 538 uterine cervical cancer (UCC) cases allowing overlaps, and 39,556 shared female controls) from Biobank Japan Project.We used the population-specific imputation reference panel (n = 3541), yielding 7,645,193 imputed variants.Analyses performed under logistic model, linear mixed model, and model incorporating correlations identified nine significant associations with three gynecologic diseases including four novel findings (rs79219469:C > T, LINC02183, P = 3.3 10-8 and rs567534295:C > T, BRCA1, P = 3.1 10-8 with OC, rs150806792:C > T, INS-IGF2, P = 4.9 10-8 and rs140991990:A > G, SOX9, P = 3.3 10-8 with UCC).Random-effect meta-analysis of the five GWASs correcting for the overlapping subjects suggested one novel shared risk locus (rs937380553:A > G, LOC730100, P = 2.0 10-8).Reverse regression analysis identified three additional novel associations (rs73494486:C > T, GABBR2, P = 4.8 10-8, rs145152209:A > G, SH3GL3/BNC1, P = 3.3 10-8, and rs147427629:G > A, LOC107985484, P = 3.8 10-8).Estimated heritability ranged from 0.026 for OC to 0.220 for endometriosis.Genetic correlations were relatively strong between OC and UEC, endometriosis and OC, and uterine fibroid and OC (rg > 0.79) compared with relatively weak correlations between UCC and the other four (rg = -0.08 ~ 0.25).We successfully identified genetic associations with gynecologic diseases in the Japanese population.Shared genetic effects among multiple related diseases may help understanding the pathophysiology. Based on microRNA (miR) microarray analysis, we previously found that miR22-5p expression is decreased in the mid-luteal endometrium of women with minimal/mild endometriosis.Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR22-5p targets ten-eleven translocation (TET2) 3-untranslated region.This study aimed to determine the regulation and roles of miR22-5p in the pathogenesis of minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility.MiR22-5p and TET2 expression in the mid-luteal endometrium from women with or without minimal/mild endometriosis was analyzed.After transfection with miR22-5p mimics or inhibitor, TET2 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT-q) PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was determined by immunofluorescence and dot blotting.Expression and promoter methylation of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting, and by bisulfite sequencing, respectively.We first established that miR22-5p expression decreased and TET2 expression increased in minimal/mild endometriosis during implantation window.TET2 was found to be a direct target of miR22-5p.MiR22-5p regulated the expression of ESR2, but did not directly affect methylation of its promoter region (-197/+359).Our results suggest that an imbalance in miR22-5p expression in the mid-luteal endometrium may be involved in minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility. Endometriosis, the presence of ectopic endometrium, has an unclear etiology and is commonly associated with endocrine, genetic, and immunological imbalance.This study determined whether immunomodulation by the RESAN vaccine could alter the potentially pathogenic gene expression profiles in the cells of the eutopic endometrium in an animal model of endometriosis.Preventing these changes could inhibit the early development of the illness and support the success of surgical treatment.Wistar rats were divided into three groups: prophylaxis (vaccinated before ectopic endometrium implantation, n = 23), therapeutic (vaccinated at the time of the ectopic excision, n = 23) and control (n = 10).During the first laparotomy, autotransplantation of the endometrium to the peritoneum was performed in the prophylaxis and therapeutic groups.The second laparotomy was carried out three months later in all groups to examine endometriotic foci and adhesions.Suspected endometriosis foci were removed.Three months later, the third laparotomy was performed in all animals, followed by suspected foci excision.Fragments of the eutopic endometrium were collected from all animals during the first and third laparotomies.All samples were analysed by real-time PCR to assess the expression of Bcl2, Bax, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, Mki67, and Tert genes.Endometrial foci were found in abdominal peritoneum at the second laparotomy in 1 animal in the prophylaxis group, compared to 16 animals in the therapeutic group.The prophylaxis group showed a high expression of Bax while the therapeutic group showed high expression of Bax, Tert and Mki67 genes.Additional analysis revealed that throughout the six months of the experiment, the expression of the Bax, Tert, and Mki67 genes decreased significantly in the prophylaxis group, Mki67 gene expression decreased in the therapeutic group, and Tert, Mki67, and Bcl2 gene expression decreased in the control group.The results indicate that immunomodulation affects the balance between apoptosis and proliferation in the eutopic endometrium and may prevent the onset and recurrence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory, gynecologic disease process in which normal endometrial tissue is abnormally present outside of the uterine cavity.Endometriomas are cystic lesions that stem from endometriosis.Endometriomas are most commonly found in the ovaries.Affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women, endometriosis is a common cause of chronic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility.Most commonly, endometriosis is found within the pelvis, specifically on the ovaries.Endometriomas are the most common manifestation of endometriosis on the ovary.However, implants can also be found throughout the abdomen, such as on the bowel, within prior surgical incisions, and even in rare cases in distant locations of the body such as the cerebellum.Approximately 17-44% of women diagnosed with endometriosis will experience an endometrioma.These lesions are commonly referred to as chocolate cysts, due to the thick dark brown appearance of the fluid that is contained within them.Endometriomas indicate a more severe disease state in patients with endometriosis and can lead to specific issues in these patients, such as decreased ovarian reserve. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus.Adolescent endometriosis is often confined to the pelvic cavity and is a common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents.Adolescent endometriosis is often with delayed diagnosis.Early diagnosis and intervention can prevent the damage of pelvic structure and ovarian tissue and reduce the incidence of adhesion and infertility.Adolescent endometriosis can be diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic biopsy.There are many kinds of drugs to treat endometriosis, such as NSAIDs, progesterone, selective progesterone receptor antagonists, GnRH-a, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, aromatase inhibitors, dopamine agonists, angiogenesis inhibitors, vegetable drugs, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.Future treatment options, including Future treatment options include CTZ, vitamin D3, oxytocin receptor inhibitors, melatonin, doxycycline, bevacizumab, curcumin, isotretinoin, and rosiglitazone, etc can inhibit ectopic lesions.This article mainly summarizes advances in medical treatment underlying adolescent endometriosis, and provides guidance for the early clinical diagnosis and intervention of adolescent endometriosis, so as to improve the quality of life of patients and reduce adverse outcomes. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease with conventional therapies which do not have desirable effectiveness and possess many side effects.Scientific evidences suggest that medicinal plants with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and/or antiproliferative properties are potential alternatives for the treatment of endometriosis.The ethanol extract of Persea americana Mill.(Lauraceae) seeds was found exhibiting antiproliferative properties in vitro and in vivo.This study therefore is aimed at investigating the effects of such an extract on an experimental model of endometriosis.Endometriosis was induced by grafting uterine fragments onto the peritoneum of female Wistar rats.After checking the success of the transplantation surgery, animals with endometriosis were orally treated with the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds at the doses of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg.The positive control was treated with letrozole (10 mg/kg) while the negative control received the vehicle.Treatments lasted 7 days and animals were sacrificed thereafter.Endometrial implant volume was determined.Estradiol and progesterone levels were measured in serum samples and endometriosis lesions.The oxidative status of endometriosis lesions was evaluated.Histological analysis of endometriosis lesions, uterus, and ovaries was also performed.Results showed that the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds decreased endometrial implant volume (p < 0.001) and serum levels of estradiol and progesterone (p < 0.01).The levels of estradiol also decreased in endometriosis lesions at doses of 12.5 and 50 mg/kg (p < 0.001).Both malondialdehyde and glutathione levels increased in endometriosis lesions (p < 0.001).The ectopic endometrium height decreased and the number of antral follicles and corpora lutea (p < 0.05) increased while that of luteinized unruptured follicles decreased (p < 0.001).In conclusion, the ethanol extract of P. americana seeds displayed an antiendometriosis effect suggesting that it could be a potential alternative for the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease which diagnostics is difficult and often invasive, therefore non-invasive diagnostics methods and parameters are needed for endometriosis detection.The aim of our study was to analyse the glycosylation of native serum IgG and IgG isolated from sera of women classified as: with endometriosis, without endometriosis but with some benign ginecological disease, and control group of healthy women, in context of its utility for differentiation of advanced endometriosis from the group of healthy women.IgG sialylation and galactosylation/agalactosylation degree was determined using specific lectins: MAA and SNA detecting sialic acid 2,3- and 2,6-linked, respectively, RCA-I and GSL-II specific to terminal Gal and terminal GlcNAc, respectively.The results of ROC and cluster analysis showed that the serum IgG MAA-reactivity, sialylation and agalactosylation factor may be used as supplementary parameters for endometriosis diagnostics and could be taken into account as a useful clinical tool to elucidate women with high risk of endometriosis development.Additionally, we have shown that the analysis of native serum IgG glycosylation, without the prior time-consuming and expensive isolation of the protein, is sufficient to differentiation endometriosis from a group of healthy women. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility.This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden.In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions.Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging.Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery.Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted.Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patients endometriosis life.Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy.In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery.Modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient-centred, multi-modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach.  Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-type mucosa outside the uterine cavity.Of the proposed pathogenic theories (retrograde menstruation, coelomic metaplasia and Mllerian remnants), none explain all the different types of endometriosis.According to the most convincing model, the retrograde menstruation hypothesis, endometrial fragments reaching the pelvis via transtubal retrograde flow, implant onto the peritoneum and abdominal organs, proliferate and cause chronic inflammation with formation of adhesions.The number and amount of menstrual flows together with genetic and environmental factors determines the degree of phenotypic expression of the disease.Endometriosis is estrogen-dependent, manifests during reproductive years and is associated with pain and infertility.Dysmenorrhoea, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia and dysuria are the most frequently reported symptoms.Standard diagnosis is carried out by direct visualization and histologic examination of lesions.Pain can be treated by excising peritoneal implants, deep nodules and ovarian cysts, or inducing lesion suppression by abolishing ovulation and menstruation through hormonal manipulation with progestins, oral contraceptives and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.Medical therapy is symptomatic, not cytoreductive; surgery is associated with high recurrence rates.Although lesion eradication is considered a fertility-enhancing procedure, the benefit on reproductive performance is moderate.Assisted reproductive technologies constitute a valid alternative.Endometriosis is associated with a 50% increase in the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer, but preventive interventions are feasible.  Endometriosis currently affects ~5.5 million reproductive-aged women in the U.S. with symptoms such as painful periods (dysmenorrhea), chronic pelvic pain, pain with intercourse (dyspareunia), and infertility.It is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and is found predominately attached to sites within the peritoneal cavity.Diagnosis for endometriosis is solely made through surgery as no consistent biomarkers for disease diagnosis exist.There is no cure for endometriosis and treatments only target symptoms and not the underlying mechanism(s) of disease.The nature of individual predisposing factors or inherent defects in the endometrium, immune system, and/or peritoneal cavity of women with endometriosis remains unclear.The literature over the last 5 years (2010-2015) has advanced our critical knowledge related to hormones, hormone receptors, immune dysregulation, hormonal treatments, and the transformation of endometriosis to ovarian cancer.In this review, we cover the aforementioned topics with the goal of providing the reader an overview and related references for further study to highlight the progress made in endometriosis research, while concluding with critical areas of endometriosis research that are urgently needed.  Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) in young women, with previous gynecological abdominal surgery, is the first condition considered by many practitioners when a tumor in the region of the scar appears.AWE seems to be caused by an iatrogenic transfer of endometrial cells at the level of the scar.The onset of the disease may be late in many cases.Despite the fact that the disease could be totally asymptomatic, there are certain risk factors that can be identified during the anamnesis, such as: heredity, menarche at the age of >14 years, menstrual cycle <27 days, delayed menopause, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption.Suggestive signs include cyclic or continuous abdominal pain caused by a palpable abdominal wall mass with a maximum tenderness in the region of the surgical scar.The differential diagnosis is complex and rare entities like desmoid tumors (DTs) must be taken into consideration.Desmoid tumor, or the so-called aggressive fibromatosis (AF), is a rare fibroblastic proliferation.This tumor can develop in any muscular aponeurotic structure of the body and is considered benign but with a high recurrence rate.DTs can cause local infiltration, subsequently producing certain levels of deformity and potential obstruction of vital structures and organs.The differential diagnosis is challenging in this situations, the imagery exams are useful, especially in detecting the precise location of the tumor.The histological examination of the tumor can state the final and precise diagnosis. Despite advances in biomedical technology, endometriosis remains a disease that is inefficiently diagnosed and treated.American women often suffer from debilitating symptoms for a decade before being diagnosed.Addressing this deficiency is crucial if women are to live well with endometriosis.Framed by relational dialectics theory 2.0, the current study analyzes womens experiences of endometriosis diagnoses via online narrative postings.Results reveal two centripetal (dominant) discourses: (a) the discourse of psycho-abnormality, and (b) the discourse of biological normality.Narrators invocation of the discourse of psycho-abnormality disqualifies womens suffering as imagined and "all in their heads," whereas invocation of the discourse of biological normality naturalizes womens suffering as "just part of being a woman."The discourse of psycho-abnormality and the discourse of biological normality, both rooted in patriarchal influences, hinder diagnosis and subsequently treatment and rehabilitation of endometriosis.Encouragingly, a third (though marginalized) discourse emerged: the discourse of reclaiming expertise.Narrators invocation of this discourse directly opposes the discourses of psycho-abnormality and biological normality by inciting validation of embodied knowledge in medical encounters and urging patients to enact agency in healthcare settings.This project discusses the interplay of these three discourses, and aims to improve diagnostic efficacy as a result. Endometriosis (EMs) is an estrogen (E2)-dependent inflammatory disorder.Although EMs is considered a benign disease, it presents with malignant characteristics, such as migration and invasion.An increasing number of studies have shown that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an essential role in disease development and progression.However, the mechanisms by which circRNAs exert their pathological effects in EMs remain unclear.Hsa_circ_0001649, a novel cancer-associated circRNA, has been previously reported to be downregulated in several cancer types and related to cell migration and invasion.In the present study, real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to measure hsa_circ_0001649 levels in human tissues, human primary endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and a human endometrial stromal cell line (ThESCs).Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels in ESCs and ThESCs were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and the migration and invasion capacities of ThESCs were evaluated by transwell assay.As a result, hsa_circ_0001649 expression was significantly decreased in ectopic and eutopic endometrial samples compared with that in normal endometrial samples.E2 decreased hsa_circ_0001649 expression but increased MMP9 expression in ESCs and ThESCs.Furthermore, ThESCs were more invasive under E2 stimulation.However, these effects disappeared when ICI or hsa_circ_0001649 transfection was used.Collectively, our findings reveal that decreased hsa_circ_0001649 expression plays a role in E2-increased MMP9 expression through E2 receptors (ERs), which have critical functions in EMs. Endometriosis is a common and challenging condition of reproductive-aged women that carries a high individual and societal cost.The many molecular dissimilarities between endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium create difficulties in the development of new drug therapies and treatments.Surgery remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but it must be weighed against the risks of surgical morbidity and potential decreases in ovarian reserve, especially in the case of endometriomas.Safe and effective surgical techniques are discussed within this article for various presentations of endometriosis.Medical therapy is suppressive rather than curative, and regimens that are long-term and affordable with minimal side effects are recommended.Recurrences are common and often rapid when medical therapy is discontinued.Endometriosis in the setting of infertility is reviewed and appropriate management is discussed, including when and whether surgery is warranted in this at-risk population.In patients with chronic pain, central sensitization and myofascial pain are integral components of a multidisciplinary approach.Endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer; however, the risk is low and currently no preventive screening is recommended.Hormone therapy for symptomatic women with postsurgical menopause should not be delayed as a result of concerns for malignancy or recurrence of endometriosis.  Regular physical exercise seems to have protective effects against diseases that involve inflammatory processes since it induces an increase in the systemic levels of cytokines with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and also acts by reducing estrogen levels.Evidence has suggested that the symptoms associated with endometriosis result from a local inflammatory peritoneal reaction caused by ectopic endometrial implants.Thus, the objective of the present review was to assess the relationship between physical exercise and the prevalence and/or improvement of the symptoms associated with endometriosis.To this end, data available in PubMed (1985-2012) were surveyed using the terms "endometriosis and physical exercises", "endometriosis and life style and physical exercises" in the English language literature.Only 6 of the 935 articles detected were included in the study.These studies tried establish a possible relationship between the practice of physical exercise and the prevalence of endometriosis.The data available are inconclusive regarding the benefits of physical exercise as a risk factor for the disease and no data exist about the potential impact of exercise on the course of the endometriosis.In addition, randomized studies are necessary.  Pelvic endometriosis is a complex syndrome characterized by an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory process that affects primarily pelvic tissues, including the ovaries.It is caused when shed endometrial tissue travels retrograde into the lower abdominal cavity.Endometriosis is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain in women and is associated with infertility.The underlying pathologic mechanisms in the intracavitary endometrium and extrauterine endometriotic tissue involve defectively programmed endometrial mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells.Although endometriotic stromal cells, which compose the bulk of endometriotic lesions, do not carry somatic mutations, they demonstrate specific epigenetic abnormalities that alter expression of key transcription factors.For example, GATA-binding factor-6 overexpression transforms an endometrial stromal cell to an endometriotic phenotype, and steroidogenic factor-1 overexpression causes excessive production of estrogen, which drives inflammation via pathologically high levels of estrogen receptor-.Progesterone receptor deficiency causes progesterone resistance.Populations of endometrial and endometriotic epithelial cells also harbor multiple cancer driver mutations, such as KRAS, which may be associated with the establishment of pelvic endometriosis or ovarian cancer.It is not known how interactions between epigenomically defective stromal cells and the mutated genes in epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis.Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain is managed by suppression of ovulatory menses and estrogen production, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and surgical removal of pelvic lesions, and in vitro fertilization is frequently used to overcome infertility.Although novel targeted treatments are becoming available, as endometriosis pathophysiology is better understood, preventive approaches such as long-term ovulation suppression may play a critical role in the future.  Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecologic diseases in women of reproductive age.It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.The women affected suffer from pelvic pain and infertility.The complex etiology is still unclear and it is based on three main theories: retrograde menstruation, coelomic metaplasia, and induction theory.Genetics and epigenetics also play a role in the development of endometriosis.Recent studies have put the attention on the role of oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, which may be implicated in the pathophysiology of endometriosis causing a general inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity.Reactive oxygen species are intermediaries produced by normal oxygen metabolism and are inflammatory mediators known to modulate cell proliferation and to have deleterious effects.A systematic review was performed in order to clarify the different roles of oxidative stress and its role in the development of endometriosis.Several issues have been investigated: iron metabolism, oxidative stress markers (in the serum, peritoneal fluid, follicular fluid, peritoneal environment, ovarian cortex, and eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue), genes involved in oxidative stress, endometriosis-associated infertility, and cancer development.  Eutopic endometrium appears to be crucial for endometriosis development.Despite of the evident importance, data regarding the cellular microenvironment remain unclear.Our objective was to explore the tissue microenvironment heterogeneity, transcripts, and pathways that are enriched in all phases of the menstrual cycle by analysing publicly deposited data derived from whole transcriptome microarrays of eutopic endometria of women with and without endometriosis.A meta-analysis of the transcriptome microarrays was performed using raw data available from a public database.Eligibility criteria included eutopic endometrium samples from women with endometriosis and healthy controls without any pathological condition reported the presence of an adequately reported normal menstrual phase, and samples containing both glandular and stromal components.Raw data were processed using a robust multiarray average method to provide background correction, normalisation, and summarisation.The batch effect was estimated by principal variant component analysis and removed using an empirical Bayes method.Cellular tissue heterogeneity was inferred using the xCell package.Differentially expressed genes were identified based on a 5% adjusted p value and a 2.0-fold change.Pathways were identified by functional enrichment based on the Molecular Signatures Database, a p value of < 5%, and an FDR q value of 25%.Genes that were more frequently found in pathways were identified using leading edge analysis.In a manner independent of cycle phase, the subpopulations of activated dendritic cells, CD4 T effector memory phenotype cells, eosinophils, macrophages M1, and natural killer T cells (NKT) were all higher in stage I-II endometriosis compared to those in healthy controls.The subpopulations of M2 macrophages and natural killer T cells were elevated in eutopic endometriums from women with stage III-IV endometriosis, and smooth muscle cells were always more prevalent in healthy eutopic endometriums.Among the differently expressed genes, FOS, FOSB, JUNB, and EGR1 were the most frequently mapped within the interaction networks, and this was independent of stage and cycle phase.The enriched pathways were directly related to immune surveillance, stem cell self-renewal, and epithelial mesenchymal transition.PI3K AKT mTOR, TGF signalling, and interferon alpha/gamma responses were enriched exclusively in stage III-IV endometriosis.The cellular microenvironments and immune cell profiles were different between eutopic endometriums from women with stage I-II and stage III-IV endometriosis, and these differences were independent of the hormonal milieu.Specifically, a pro-inflammatory profile was predominant in stage I-II endometriosis, and M1-M2 polarization into eutopic endometrium may be crucial for the progression of the disease.The higher prevalence of NKT cells in eutopic endometriums from women with endometriosis that was independent of cycle phase or staging suggested a sustained stress and/or damage to these eutopic endometriums.Based on this, the results of this meta-analysis are important for identifying challenges and opportunities for future research. Pathogenesis of endometriosis is still unclear and a role of both innate and adaptive immune system has been postulated.Some recent findings have revealed an increased risk to have concomitant autoimmune disease in women with endometriosis, but no study so far has investigated whether this association could affect endometriosis severity and stage.We retrospectively reviewed medical patients notes of women with a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis who referred to our endometriosis outpatient clinic between January 2015 and December 2019.Cases (endometriosis and an autoimmune disease) were matched in a 1:3 ratio by age and study period with controls (endometriosis without history of autoimmunity).At univariate logistic analysis, concomitant autoimmunity (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.64-4.21, p < 0.001) and the number of laparoscopic procedures performed (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.45-5.43, p = 0.002) emerged as factors significantly associated with the likelihood of stage IV endometriosis.In the multivariate logistic regression model, concomitant autoimmunity remained a significant predictor of stage IV endometriosis (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.57-4.10, p = 0.004), whereas the association between the number of laparoscopic procedures performed and stage IV endometriosis was found to be of borderline-significance (OR 2.70, 95% 1.37-5.30, p = 0.050).Our findings suggest that endometriosis is more severe in patients who are also affected by autoimmune disturbances after controlling for relevant confounders. Sensory and sympathetic nerves have been shown to promote the progression of endometriosis through the release of neuromediators and the lesional activation of respective receptors.The role of vagus nerves (VN) in lesional progression, however, is completely unclear, despite the signs suggestive of increased sympathetic tone in women with endometriosis.This study was undertaken to investigate whether VN plays any role in the progression of endometriosis.We recruited 45 patients with endometriosis and 42 healthy women, who were given electrocardiogram test and their heart rate variability was evaluated.In addition, three prospective, and randomized mouse experiments were conducted that evaluated, respectively, the effect of vagotomy, the effect of VN stimulation (VNS), and the therapeutic potential of VNS after the endometriosis was well established.All lesions were excised, weighed, and processed for immunohistochemistry and histochemistry analysis of select markers for lesional progression and fibrosis.We found that endometriosis patients exhibited reduced vagal activity as compared with controls, indicative of disrupted autonomic balance.Vagotomy increased while VNS decreased the lesion weight as compared with control mice, concomitant with more progressive and retarded lesion development and fibrogenesis, respectively.In addition, VNS demonstrated promising therapeutic effect, as evidenced by significantly reduced lesion weight, more attenuated lesional progression concomitant with improved hyperalgesia.Taken together, our data indicate that VN activity may play a dampening role in the progression of endometriosis.Consequently, boosting the VN activity may have therapeutic potentials for patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopic anterior resection of rectum (AR) is one of surgical approaches for deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).Up to date, no clinical trials have clearly analyzed the short-term and long-term complications post-surgically, indications or feasibilities for surgical procedure, or post-operative recovery.The aims of this trial were to evaluate the indications for laparoscopic AR, the short-term and long-term complications post-surgically, post-operative recovery.We conducted a prospective study of 29 patients.They were divided into 2 groups.The period of follow-up was 12 months post-surgery.In our study, we recruited patents with laparoscopic AR experiencing failure of medical treatment (3 months) or associated infertility (>2cycles).The operative data and short term and long term complications were recorded.The outcomes of laparoscopic AR group were assessed by questionnaires, such as NRS (numeric rating scale), KESS (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom Questionnaire), VAS (visual analogue scale), WCS (Wexner constipation score) and ABS (Abdominal Bloating Score), which were compared with the outcomes of medicine group at set time points of baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.The overall outcomes of the two groups were assessed with 5-point Likert Scale.Patients in surgery group were recovery rapidly without serious short term or long term complications.All of NRS, KESS, VAS, WCS, and ABS in surgery group were getting better greatly than that in medicine group (3.04 1.91 vs 5.41 3.01, 5.64 1.54 vs 7.01 1.03, 0.50 0.38 vs 3.58 2.01, 4.43 1.02 vs 8.92 2.45, and 0.61 0.34 vs 1.42 0.71) at 3 months post-operation.However, the advantage of surgery group was almost vanished at 12 months (4.02 2.53 vs 5.99 2.31, 7.42 3.17 vs 10.98 2.53, 1.59 1.3 vs 2.23 1.59, 6.01 2.53 vs 7.90 3.25, and 1.31 1.05 vs 1.39 1.02).Furthermore, we compared the overall outcomes between the 2 groups with 5-point Likert Scale, with confirmation of the advantage at 3 months post-surgically.Additionally, we compared these questionnaires, with the finding that VAS and 5-point Likert Scale of surgery group had the same changes.Finally, a table of indications for laparoscopic AR were tabulated according our clinical experience.Patients can receive benefit from both medicine and laparoscopic AR.However, laparoscopic AR has obvious advantage of rapid symptom relief.Further studies and clinical data collections are required for indications and feasibility of combined therapy. To determine whether genetic predisposition to endometriosis varies depending on ethnicity and in association with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in a Taiwanese population.We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replicated it in 259 individuals with laparoscopy-confirmed stage III or IV endometriosis (cases) and 171 women without endometriosis (controls).Their genomic DNA was extracted from blood and evaluated by the GWAS of Taiwan Biobank Array.Novel genetic variants that predispose individuals to endometriosis were identified using GWAS and replication, including rs10739199 (P = 6.75 10-5) and rs2025392 (P = 8.01 10-5) at chromosome 9, rs1998998 (P = 6.5 10-6) at chromosome 14, and rs6576560 (P = 9.7 10-6) at chromosome 15.After imputation, strong signals were exhibited by rs10822312 (P = 1.80 10-7) at chromosome 10, rs58991632 (P = 1.92 10-6) and rs2273422 (P = 2.42 10-6) at chromosome 20, and rs12566078 (P = 2.5 10-6) at chromosome 1.We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to observe eQTL.Among these SNPs, the cis-eQTL rs13126673 of inturned planar cell polarity protein (INTU) showed significant association with INTU expression (P = 5.1 10-33).Moreover, the eQTL analysis was performed on endometriotic tissues from women with endometriosis.The expression of INTU in 78 endometriotic tissue of women with endometriosis is associated with rs13126673 genotype (P = 0.034).To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS to link endometriosis and eQTL in a Taiwanese population. BACKGROUND Endometriosis is an ectopic proliferation of endometrial glands and interstitium outside the uterus.It usually affects the organs surrounding the uterus, and less often, involvement of extrapelvic organs, such as the intestines and urinary tract, is observed.CASE REPORT A 40-year-old woman had been experiencing intermittent right lower abdominal pain for years, which worsened months earlier.The patient was admitted for the worst pain ever accompanying nausea and vomiting.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a heterogeneously enhanced lesion that measured approximately 502535 mm, and a caliber change of the ileum at the same site with dilated small bowel proximal to the caliber change were observed.Colonoscopy revealed that the ileocecal valve and the lumen of the terminal ileum protruded inward, suggesting an extramural compression by the lesion.Since the patient showed no improvement following conservative therapy, bowel resection through a single-incision laparoscopic surgery was successfully performed.Histopathological exploration showed patchy infiltration of endometrium-like tissues in the muscularis propria and subserosa layers of the ileum and appendix.Moreover, nearby lymph nodes resected for their firmness showed similar findings.CONCLUSIONS We report a case of recurrent intestinal obstruction due to ileal and appendiceal endometriosis with lymph node involvement, which was successfully treated by single-incision laparoscopic surgery.Careful follow-up is important because the prognosis for the intestinal endometriosis with lymph node involvement is still unclear. Endometriosis is associated with dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility.The specific mechanism of endometriosis remains unclear.The aim of this study was to apply a bioinformatics approach to reveal related pathways or genes involved in the development of endometriosis.The gene expression profiles of GSE25628, GSE5108, and GSE7305 were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database.Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed using GEO2R.The database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) was utilized to analyze the functional enrichment, gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway of the differentially expressed genes.A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and module analysis was performed using search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes and cytoscape.A total of 119 common differentially expressed genes were extracted, consisting of 51 downregulated genes and 68 upregulated genes.The enriched functions and pathways of the DEGs and hub genes include DNA strand separation, cellular proliferation, degradation of the extracellular matrix, encoding of smooth muscle myosin as a major contractile protein, exiting the proliferative cycle and entering quiescence, growth regulation, and implication in a wide variety of biological processes.A bioinformatics approach combined with cell experiments in this study revealed that identifying DEGs and hub genes leads to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of endometriosis, and efficient biomarkers underlying this pathway need to be further investigated. Hyperactivation of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis occurs in endometriosis; the therapeutic potential of treatments aimed at global inhibition of the axis was recently reported.Because CXCR4 is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells in the uterus, this study explored the effects of targeted disruption of CXCR4 in endometriosis lesions.Uteri derived from adult female mice homozygous for a floxed allele of CXCR4 and co-expressing Cre recombinase under control of progesterone receptor promoter were sutured onto the peritoneum of cycling host mice expressing the green fluorescent protein.Four weeks after endometriosis induction, significantly lower number of lesions developed in Cxcr4-conditional knockout lesions relative to those in controls (37.5% vs. 68.8%, respectively).In lesions that developed in Cxcr4-knockout, reduced epithelial proliferation was associated with a lower ratio of epithelial to total lesion area compared with controls.Furthermore, while CD3+ lymphocytes were largely excluded from the epithelial compartment in control lesions, in Cxcr4-knockout lesions, CD3+ lymphocytes infiltrated the Cxcr4-deficient epithelium in the diestrus and proestrus stages.Current data demonstrate that local CXCR4 expression is necessary for proliferation of the epithelial compartment of endometriosis lesions, that its downregulation compromises lesion numbers, and suggest a role for epithelial CXCR4 in lesion immune evasion. Endometriosis affects a great proportion of women during their reproductive years and may impair female fertility in several ways.Ovarian endometrioma (OE) is the most frequent phenotype and growing evidence suggest an endometrioma-mediated damage to the ovary, ovarian reserve and oocyte quality.Traditionally, surgery has been the first-line treatment in cases of OE.Great advances in assisted reproduction and fertility preservation techniques opened new possibilities towards a more conservative approach.Herein we discuss multiple mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of the reproductive capacity in cases of OE as well as the pros and cons of different treatment options.The management of endometrioma-related subfertility remains controversial and it will depend on patients intentions and priorities.In the "internet era" patients tend to be hyper-informed and more participative, but they are often misguided and misinformed.Thus, doctors should be able to convert these individuals into well-informed patients in order to facilitate the process of shared decision making, which is extremely relevant in the context of OEs. Human reproductive success depends on a properly decidualized uterine endometrium that allows implantation and the formation of the placenta.At the core of the decidualization process are endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESF) that differentiate to decidual stromal cells (DSC).As variations in oxygen levels are functionally relevant in endometrium both upon menstruation and during placentation, we assessed the transcriptomic responses to hypoxia in ESF and DSC.In both cell types, hypoxia-upregulated genes in classical hypoxia pathways such as glycolysis and the epithelial mesenchymal transition.In DSC, hypoxia restored an ESF-like transcriptional state for a subset of transcription factors that are known targets of the progesterone receptor, suggesting that hypoxia partially interferes with progesterone signaling.In both cell types, hypoxia modified transcription of several inflammatory transcription factors that are known regulators of decidualization, including decreased transcription of STATs and increased transcription of CEBPs.We observed that hypoxia-upregulated genes in ESF and DSC had a significant overlap with genes previously detected to be upregulated in endometriotic stromal cells.Promoter analysis of the genes in this overlap suggested the hypoxia-upregulated Jun/Fos and CEBP transcription factors as potential drivers of endometriosis-associated transcription.Using immunohistochemistry, we observed increased expression of JUND and CEBPD in endometriosis lesions compared to healthy endometria.Overall, the findings suggest that hypoxic stress establishes distinct transcriptional states in ESF and DSC and that hypoxia influences the expression of genes that contribute to the core gene regulation of endometriotic stromal cells. Endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain can at times be a complex problem that is resistant to standard medical and surgical therapies.Multiple comorbidities and central sensitization may be at play and must be recognized with the help of a thorough history and physical examination.If a complex pain problem is identified, most endometriosis expert reviews and guidelines recommend multidisciplinary care.However, there are no specific recommendations about what should be the components of this approach and how that type of team care should be delivered.There is evidence showing the effectiveness of specific interventions such as pain education, physical therapy, psychological therapies, and pharmacotherapies for the treatment of chronic pain.Interdisciplinary team models have been well studied and validated in other chronic pain conditions such as low back pain.The published evidence in support of interdisciplinary teams for endometriosis-associated chronic pain is more limited but appears promising.Based on the available evidence, a model for an interdisciplinary team approach for endometriosis care is outlined. Endometriosis remains an enigmatic disease of unknown etiology, with delayed diagnosis and poor therapeutic options.This review will discuss the cellular, physiological, and genomic evidence of Sampsons hypothesis of retrograde menstruation as a cause of pelvic endometriosis and as the basis of phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease.We postulate that collaborative research at the single cell level focused on unlocking the cellular, physiological, and genomic mechanisms of endometriosis will be accompanied by advances in personalized diagnosis and therapies that target unique subtypes of endometriosis disease.These advances will address the clinical conundrums of endometriosis clinical care-including diagnostic delay, suboptimal treatments, disease recurrence, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and quality of life.There is an urgent need to improve outcomes for women with endometriosis.To achieve this, it is imperative that we understand which cells form the lesions, how they arrive at distant sites, and what factors govern their ability to survive and invade at ectopic locations.This review proposes new research avenues to address these basic questions of endometriosis pathobiology that will lay the foundations for new diagnostic tools and treatment pathways. Serum anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) levels decrease after surgical treatment of ovarian endometrioma.This is the main reason that surgery for ovarian endometrioma endometriosis is not recommended before in vitro fertilization, unless the patient has severe pain or suspected malignant cysts.Furthermore, it has been suggested that ovarian endometrioma itself damages ovarian reserve.This raises two important challenges: (1) determining how to prevent surgical damage to the ovarian reserve in women with ovarian endometrioma and severe pain requiring surgical treatment and (2) deciding the best treatment for women with ovarian endometrioma without pain, who do not wish to conceive immediately.The mechanisms underlying the decline in ovarian reserve are potentially induced by both ovarian endometrioma and surgical injury but the relative contribution of each process has not been determined.Data obtained from various animal models and human studies suggest that hyperactivation of dormant primordial follicles caused by the local microenvironment of ovarian endometrioma (mechanical and/or chemical cues) is the main factor responsible for the decreased primordial follicle numbers in women with ovarian endometrioma.However, surgical injury also induces hyperactivation of dormant primordial follicles, which may further reduce ovarian reserve after removal of the endometriosis.Although further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying diminished ovarian reserve in women with ovarian endometrioma, the available data strongly suggests the need to prevent/minimize hyperactivation of dormant primordial follicles, regardless of whether surgery is performed, for better clinical management of ovarian endometrioma. To map the distribution of the sites most affected by endometriosis in patients with unilateral ovarian endometriomas.A descriptive case series of 84 patients with unilateral endometriomas undergoing laparoscopy for the treatment of endometriosis.To evaluate the distribution of the sites of endometriosis lesions, the peritoneal compartments were divided into 5 zones: zone 1/the anterior compartment, including the anterior uterine serosa, vesicouterine fold, round ligament, and bladder; zone 2/the lateral compartment, including the left and right ovary, ovarian fossa, tubes, mesosalpinx, uterosacral ligaments, parametrium, and the ureter; zone 3/the posterior compartment, including posterior uterine serosa, the pouch of Douglas, posterior vaginal fornix, and bowel; zone 4 consisting of the abdominal wall; and zone 5 consisting of the diaphragm.Of the 5 zones evaluated, the lateral compartment (zone 2) was the most affected, with 60.7% of the patients having dense adhesions around the left ovarian fossa and 57.1% around the right ovarian fossa.The ovarian endometriomas were more commonly found on the left side (54.8%) compared to the right (45.2%).In the posterior compartment (zone 3), the posterior cul-de-sac was obliterated in 51.2% of the patients.In the anterior compartment (zone 1), there were lesions in the vesicouterine fold in 30.9% of the patients and in the bladder in 19%.Lesions were found in the abdominal wall (zone 4) and diaphragm (zone 5) in 21.4% and 10.7% of patients, respectively.Unilateral endometriomas are important markers of the severity of endometriosis. Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) affects a significant number of women worldwide.Internationally, people with endometriosis report significant negative impact across many areas of their life.We aimed to use an online survey using the EndoCost tool to determine if there was any difference in the impact of CPP in those with vs. those without a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis, and if there was any change in diagnostic delay since the introduction of clinical guidelines in 2005.409 responses were received; 340 with a diagnosis of endometriosis and 69 with no diagnosis.People with CPP, regardless of diagnosis, reported moderate to severe dysmenorrhea and non-cyclical pelvic pain.Dyspareunia was also common.Significant negative impact was reported for social, academic, and sexual/romantic relationships in both cohorts.In the endometriosis cohort there was a mean diagnostic delay of eight years, however there was a reduction in both the diagnostic delay (p < 0.001) and number of doctors seen before diagnosis (p < 0.001) in those presenting more recently.Both endometriosis and CPP have significant negative impact.Whilst there is a decrease in the time to diagnosis, there is an urgent need for improved treatment options and support for women with the disease once the diagnosis is made. Endometriosis is a common chronic inflammatory condition causing pelvic pain and infertility in women, with limited treatment options and 50% heritability.We leveraged genetic analyses in two species with spontaneous endometriosis, humans and the rhesus macaque, to uncover treatment targets.We sequenced DNA from 32 human families contributing to a genetic linkage signal on chromosome 7p13-15 and observed significant overrepresentation of predicted deleterious low-frequency coding variants in NPSR1, the gene encoding neuropeptide S receptor 1, in cases (predominantly stage III/IV) versus controls (P = 7.8 10-4).Significant linkage to the region orthologous to human 7p13-15 was replicated in a pedigree of 849 rhesus macaques (P = 0.0095).Targeted association analyses in 3194 surgically confirmed, unrelated cases and 7060 controls revealed that a common insertion/deletion variant, rs142885915, was significantly associated with stage III/IV endometriosis (P = 5.2 10-5; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.39).Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that NPSR1 was expressed in glandular epithelium from eutopic and ectopic endometrium, and on monocytes in peritoneal fluid.The NPSR1 inhibitor SHA 68R blocked NPSR1-mediated signaling, proinflammatory TNF- release, and monocyte chemotaxis in vitro (P < 0.01), and led to a significant reduction of inflammatory cell infiltrate and abdominal pain (P < 0.05) in a mouse model of peritoneal inflammation as well as in a mouse model of endometriosis.We conclude that the NPSR1/NPS system is a genetically validated, nonhormonal target for the treatment of endometriosis with likely increased relevance to stage III/IV disease. Endometriosis and adenomyosis are two frequent diseases that impair womens quality of life by causing pain and infertility.Both endometriosis and adenomyosis are heterogeneous diseases that manifest as different forms.Adenomyosis may be described as diffuse adenomyosis, focal adenomyosis especially of the outer myometrium and cystic adenomyoma.Endometriosis has three phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SUP), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).These two diseases are closely linked, and it is now clear that adenomyosis can either arise on its own or coexist with endometriosis.There is a strong clinical relationship between endometriosis and adenomyosis according to their respective phenotypes.Various classifications are available to describe both diseases.Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the first examination performed when endometriosis or adenomyosis are suspected.These two imaging techniques, used in a combination manner, allow accurate description of both endometriosis and adenomyosis, to assess the diagnosis and to improve clinical and surgical care.In this review, we described the different imaging aspects of endometriosis and adenomyosis to help the less experienced radiologist or gynecologist in the diagnosis and evaluation of those diseases. Endometriosis is a common disease in women, which impairs the quality of life in patients.Recently, accumulating evidences reported that miRNAs play an essential role in diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.However, the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs has not been fully explored.The expression of miR-17-5p and VEGFA was detected using qRT-PCR.The protein level of VEGFA was measured via Western blot.Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay.Cell migration and invasion were measured via transwell assay.The relationship of miR-17-5p and VEGFA were verified via luciferase reporter assay.Then miR-17-5p was remarkably down-regulated in endometriosis tissues, serums and cells, and overexpression of miR-17-5p inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in endometriosis.Results showed that VEGFA was significantly up-regulated in endometriosis tissues and cells and acted as a target of miR-17-5p.Moreover, miR- 17-5p negatively regulated VEGFA expression in endometriosis.Otherwise, up-regulation of VEGFA improved cell proliferative, migrated and invasive ability in ECSCs with transfection of miR-17-5p mimics group.Our data showed miR-17-5p inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in endometriosis by directly repressing VEGFA expression. Deep endometriosis (DE) is classically defined as disease that infiltrates structures by more than 5 mm, such as bowel, ureters, bladder and vagina.The two major symptoms related to DE are pain and infertility.A lot of debate goes on upon the best treatment choice for DE.Treatments include medical therapy with oral progestins or combined contraceptives, and surgery for resection of DE nodules.In this review we focus on the best option treatment for the symptomatic patients with DE not seeking conception.We performed a narrative review of literature searching for the latest evidence on efficacy and outcomes of medical and surgical treatment of DE patients.Results showed that 2/3 of patients with DE will be satisfied with hormonal treatment, and surgery will be effective in improving QoL in most patients with DE.Most studies published regarding surgical outcomes involve bowel endometriosis, and their complication rates should not be extrapolated to all DE.DE that does not infiltrate pelvic viscera accounts for most cases of DE.Together with DE affecting the urinary tract, a much lower rate of severe complications is reported when compared to bowel endometriosis.This distinction should influence decision making.Medical treatment should be first option for non-complicated DE patients not seeking conception.Surgery should be indicated for those who do not tolerate nor improve with medical treatment, as well as those cases complicated by visceral impairment. Repeated tissue injury and repair and fibrosis play a pivotal role in endometriosis.Fibrotic tissue consists of extracellular matrix proteins, regulated by transcriptional factors promoting cell proliferation and survival.Periostin is one of the putative key extracellular matrix proteins.This study aimed to determine whether transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is involved in the development of endometriosis as an upstream regulatory gene of periostin.Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples [normal endometrium of women without endometriosis; eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis; ovarian endometriosis (OE); and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)] and respective cells were analyzed.Basal, transiently stimulated, and knocked down periostin and TCF21 concentrations in stromal cells of women with or without endometriosis were examined.Periostin and TCF21 expressions were undetected in normal endometrium of women without endometriosis, weakly positive in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis, moderately positive in OE, and strongly positive in DIE.Type 2 helper T-cell cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-1) increased the mRNA expression of periostin and TCF21.These cytokines, periostin, and TCF21 colocalized in the stroma of OE and DIE.siRNA against human TCF21 gene suppressed periostin expression.Transfection of TCF21 plasmid vector into stromal cells of women without endometriosis, which originally expressed neither periostin nor TCF21, resulted in TCF21 and periostin expression.TCF21 and periostin are involved in the regulation of fibrosis in endometriosis.TCF21 may be a promising therapeutic target and biomarker in endometriosis. A clinically reliable non-invasive test for endometriosis is expected to reduce the diagnostic delay.Although varieties of biomarkers have been investigated for decades, and cancer antigen-125, cancer antigen-199, interleukin-6, and urocortin were the most studied ones among hundreds of biomarkers, no clinically reliable biomarkers have been confirmed so far.Some emerging technologies including "omics" technologies, molecular imaging techniques, and microRNAs are promising in solving these challenges, but their utility to detect endometriosis has yet to be verified.New combinations of researched indicators or other non-invasive methods and further exploration of the emerging technologies may be new targets and future research hotspots for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis.In conclusion, researches of biomarkers for the detection of endometriosis are still ongoing and may benefit from novel molecular biology, bioinformatics methods and a combination of more diverse monitoring methods.Though it will be a daunting task, the identification of a specific set of diagnostic biomarkers will undoubtedly improve the status of endometriosis. Endometriosis remains an enigmatic disease of unknown etiology, with delayed diagnosis and poor therapeutic options.This review will discuss the cellular, physiological, and genomic evidence of Sampsons hypothesis of retrograde menstruation as a cause of pelvic endometriosis and as the basis of phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease.We postulate that collaborative research at the single cell level focused on unlocking the cellular, physiological, and genomic mechanisms of endometriosis will be accompanied by advances in personalized diagnosis and therapies that target unique subtypes of endometriosis disease.These advances will address the clinical conundrums of endometriosis clinical care-including diagnostic delay, suboptimal treatments, disease recurrence, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and quality of life.There is an urgent need to improve outcomes for women with endometriosis.To achieve this, it is imperative that we understand which cells form the lesions, how they arrive at distant sites, and what factors govern their ability to survive and invade at ectopic locations.This review proposes new research avenues to address these basic questions of endometriosis pathobiology that will lay the foundations for new diagnostic tools and treatment pathways.  Endometriosis is a benign gynecologic disorder that is defined as functional endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity.It is an estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease that leads to symptoms of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility, occurring in 6-10% of reproductive aged women.The severity of the disease ranges from asymptomatic to debilitating symptoms that have a major impact on womens lives.It is a chronic, recurrent disease, frequently requiring long term management until menopause and beyond.It is considered a chronic disorder that is managed with surgery, medical treatment, and oftentimes, both.Current medical therapy for endometriosis is considered suppressive of the disease, rather than curative.Fortunately, many patients do experience improvement and control of their symptoms with medical therapy.However, long-term efficacy of the medical treatments is often limited by side effects and the cost of therapy, and symptoms do tend to recur after discontinuation of these medications.This review summarizes our understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis and provides more in-depth discussion of specific medical management options used to treat endometriosis, including mechanism of action and side effects.It also provides recommendations on strategy with a forward look to novel endometriosis treatments in the future.The authors emphasized that endometriosis is a chronic disorder requiring long term medical therapy.Early diagnosis of endometriosis is key in preventing severe, debilitating symptoms and progression of disease.By utilizing our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of endometriosis and by correctly implementing currently available medical and surgical therapies we can significantly reduce the physical, psychosocial and financial burden of this chronic, recurrent and indolent disease.Current available medications are suppressive therapies, but the authors are looking forward to future therapies that can effectively cure or at least control endometriosis with minimal side effects.Future research should continue to look for the genetic trigger for endometriosis which can lead us to its underlying pathogenesis and eventually a cure or prevention. Endometriosis can take one of three forms depending on its clinical presentation and management: endometriotic ovarian cyst (ovarian endometrioma), superficial or peritoneal endometriosis and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).1Among them, DIE is considered the most aggressive, and the patient is often affected by more than one type together.The therapeutic methodology should not be influenced by a combination of different types of endometriotic lesion.According to the clinical context and the patients needs, the treatment of this pathology can be medical or surgical.Although medical therapy could improve endometriosis-associated symptoms, it never offers a definite treatment for symptomatic patients, who often require surgical treatment.The rationale behind endometriosis surgical treatment is to achieve the complete removal of all lesions through a one-step surgical procedure; to obtain promising long-term results for pelvic pain, recurrence rate, and fertility; and to protect the functionality of the involved organs.Achieving these results depends on the total removal of the pathology from the pelvis, in an attempt to preserve, as much as possible, the healthy tissues surrounding the site of the disease.The choice of a surgical approach rather than medical therapy is subject to the patients expectations, such as pregnancy desire, the effectiveness of treatment compared to possible complications, the type of pain and its intensity, and the location and severity of the disease.In this context, surgical management using a multidisciplinary endometriosis team is an important factor for achieving good outcomes. Endometriosis (EMs) is a benign disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.EMs associated with ovarian cancer (OC) has a relative low incidence (5% to 10%), sometimes with evidence of a transition stage through atypical EMs (1.6% cases).We have assessed 135 consecutive patients with either EMs or OC and, out of them, our study reports on four cases of ovarian EMs and OC: two cases with endometrioid OC and two cases with high-grade serous OC (HGSOC).Cases with EMs and HGSOC are extremely rarely reported in the literature - we could find not more than 30 cases.The main objective of our research was to observe the possible similarities between EMs and OC.Secondly, we analyzed the differences between EMs associated with endometrioid OC and EMs associated with HGSOC.We evaluated them in terms of clinical status (age, stages of EMs and OC) and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki67, p53, p16, Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), cluster of differentiation (CD) 34 and CD10 immunomarkers - we could not find in the literature all these markers assessed, in the same time, to such samples.Our results indicated that there are no similarities between EMs and OC and no atypical EMs was identified in our cases.We recorded higher values of ER expression in EMs associated with HGSOC than in EMs associated with endometrioid OC.Higher values of ER expression were also recorded in OC than in endometriotic foci.There were no differences in proliferative rate of endometriotic foci associated with endometrioid OC, compared to EMs associated with HGSOC.An aberrant IHC expression for p53 protein and p16 protein was noted only in HGSOC.Also, a positive immunostaining for Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) was identified only in HGSOC.Higher values of microvessel density were recorded in OC but not in endometriotic foci.We concluded that there were no similarities between EMs and OC for the cases included in our study, but we noticed differences in terms of Ki67 index and also between hormonal receptors expression in EMs associated with HGSOC, comparing with EMs associated with endometrioid OCs.These results may represent a "brick" for future researches on the less understood EMs associated with type II of OCs, especially with HGSOC.Identifying the best marker, which can predict the risk of developing OC for the patients with EMs, may lead to discover new specific therapeutic agents and, therefore, a better, tailored, therapy. To examine the association between endometriosis and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), this nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted based on National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan.Endometriosis (N = 16,758) and non-endometriosis (N = 16,758) groups were identified by matching baseline characteristics and comorbidities.Students t-tests and the Kaplan-Meier estimator were utilized to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and cumulative probability of SLE in the two groups.The endometriosis group showed a significantly higher incidence density rate (0.3 vs. 0.1 per 1000 person-years) and hazard ratio in SLE group (adjusted HR [aHR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-4.14) compared to the non-endometriosis group.Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with endometriosis between 30 and 45 years of age, or were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, or were hormonal medications-free participants, had higher risks of SLE.For patients with endometriosis, surgical intervention did not significantly impact on the risk of SLE.Our results demonstrated an increased risk of SLE in patients with endometriosis.Clinicians should be aware of this association when managing patients with endometriosis or SLE. Endometriosis is one of the most frequent gynecological diseases in reproductive age women, but its etiology is not completely understood.Endometriosis is characterized by progesterone resistance, which has been explained in part by a decrease in the expression of the intracellular progesterone receptor in the ectopic endometrium.Progesterone action is also mediated by nongenomic mechanisms via membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) that belong to the class II members of the progesterone and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression at mRNA and protein levels of mPR members in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis.Total RNA and total protein were isolated from control endometrium (17 samples), eutopic endometrium (17 samples), and ectopic endometrium (9 samples).The expression of PAQR7 (mPR), PAQR8 (mPR), and PAQR6 (mPR) at mRNA and protein levels was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot, whereas PAQR5 (mPR) gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR.Statistical analysis between comparable groups was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys multiple comparisons test with a confidence interval of 95 %.The analysis of gene expression showed that PAQR7 and PAQR5 expression was lower in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium as compared to the endometrium of women without endometriosis, whereas the expression of PAQR8 and PAQR6 was only reduced in eutopic endometrium.Furthermore, mPR and mPR protein content was decreased in the ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis.Our results demonstrate a decrease in the expression and protein content of mPRs in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis, which could contribute to the progesterone resistance observed in patients with this disease. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease that affects approximately 10% of women.Debilitating pelvic or abdominal pain is one of its major clinical features.Current animal models of endometriosis-associated pain require surgery either to implant tissue or to remove the ovaries.Moreover, existing models do not induce spontaneous pain, which is the primary symptom of patients with chronic pain, including endometriosis.A lack of models that accurately recapitulate the disease phenotype must contribute to the high failure rate of clinical trials for analgesic drugs directed at chronic pain, including those for endometriosis.We set out to establish a murine model of endometriosis-associated pain.Endometriosis was induced nonsurgically by injecting a dissociated uterine horn into a recipient mouse.The induced lesions exhibited histological features that resemble human lesions along with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of immune cells.We also observed the presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide-, TRPA1-, and TRPV1-expressing nerve fibers in the lesions.This model induced mechanical allodynia, spontaneous abdominal pain, and changes in thermal selection behavior that indicate discomfort.These behavioral changes were reduced by drugs used clinically for endometriosis, specifically letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) and danazol (androgen).Endometriosis also induced neuronal changes as evidenced by activation of the NF-B signaling pathway in TRPA1- and TRPV1-expressing dorsal root ganglion neurons.In conclusion, we have established a model of endometriosis-associated pain that responds to clinically active drugs and can, therefore, be used to identify novel therapies. Endometriosis is a chronic disease frequently associated with female infertility.The choice of treatment in case of endometriosis is one of the most discussed topics in Reproductive Medicine.The approach to the patient with endometriosis and infertility should be tailored based on different parameters.The localization of the disease, the severity of symptoms and the age of the patient are just some of them.Management options include surgery, in-vitro fertilization (IVF), or a combination of both.Data, mostly uncontrolled, would favor surgery at any stage of endometriosis, increasing the chances of natural conception compared to expectant management.Laparoscopic excision of the ovarian endometrioma should be the treatment of choice when there is associated pain.Surgery should be performed following appropriate techniques to reduce the possible damage to the ovarian reserve.Pregnancy rates around 50% have been consistently reported after surgery, which compare favorably with those obtained with IVF.IVF, on the other hand, may be preferred in case of associated male or tubal factor, in case of a reduced ovarian reserve, or if previous surgery has failed, particularly if there is no associated pain, and when the ultrasonographic features of the ovarian cyst are reassuring.Sometimes IVF may be preceded by surgery, when a difficult access to follicles at pick-up, due to the size and location of the ovarian cyst, or to severe adhesions, is anticipated.Due to the lack of solid evidence in the scenario of endometriosis-associated infertility, robust data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are strongly needed. Triptorelin has been used after surgery in deep infiltrating endometriosis.This post-hoc analysis aimed to evaluate symptom control between patients receiving 1-3 triptorelin injections and those receiving 4-6 injections within 24 months of conservative surgery for deep infiltrating endometriosis, in the real-world.Included patients were divided into two groups (received up to 3 months injections in group A, 4-6 injections in group B) based on the numbers of triptorelin (Diphereline, 3.75 mg intramuscular injection once every 28 days for up to 24 weeks) administration.Evolution in score of pain intensity at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after primary triptorelin administration and symptom improvement/recurrence rates between two groups were compared.Symptoms of pain intensity were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with a range from 0 to 10 cm.An improvement in symptoms was defined as a reduction of at least 3 cm or 3 units from pre-surgery levels.156 patients in group A and 228 in group B.Pain symptom score (mean standard deviation) diminished to a nadir at 3-months for group A and 6-months for group B; at 6-months nadir scores were significantly lower in group B (0.9 1.7 vs 0.4 1.2 respectively, P = .002).No significant difference for pain symptom scores between both groups at 24-months (P = .269).The 6-month and 24-month cumulative improvement rates of pain (80.6% vs 89.8%, P = .014 and 82.6% vs 90.7%, P = .025) and gastro-intestinal symptoms (61.0% vs 80.8%, P = .022 and 61.0% vs 83.3%, P = .008) were significantly higher in group B, whereas there was no significant difference in rates of menstrual disorders and urinary symptoms.There is no significant difference for 12-months and 24-months cumulative recurrence rates of total symptoms between both groups (11.3% vs 13.8%, P = .568 and 16.1% vs 26.0%, P = .094).In women with deep infiltrating endometriosis, longer treatment with triptorelin following conservative surgery was associated with a decrease in symptom intensity and greater improvement of pain symptoms in the short-term and greater improvement of gastro-intestinal symptoms in the long-term.Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01942369. Endometriosis in adolescence represents a specific variant of the disease with its own characteristics and, in some cases, even a possibly different pathogenesis.It has its own clinical presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.The condition is not rare as once thought and certainly deserves attention in view of increasing evidence of its likely progressive nature.Numerous theories for its pathogenesis have been formulated and they have been divided into two main categories: the in-situ and the "transplantation" hypotheses.Clinical manifestations include as the prevailing symptom a persistent chronic pelvic pain, despite medical treatment, manifested under various forms: dysmenorrhea, acyclic chronic pain, acute abdominal pain and migraines.These symptoms can substantially affect the quality of life on an adolescent.At histopathology, adolescent endometriosis is characterized by a high proportion of subtle, clear, red or vesicular implants and by the rarity of deep nodules.Frequently, the picture includes ovarian endometriomas.In some adolescent girls, lesions may regress or even disappear, probably through immune suppression; in others, chronic stress, unhealthy diet or lifestyle such as high-fat diet, may accelerate lesional progression and cause symptoms.Classically, management of adolescent endometriosis has been centered on attempts to treat dysmenorrhea; today both medical and surgical modalities have the potential to improve quality of life, alleviate symptoms, prevent the development of more severe disease and minimize risks for future fertility in adolescents.Nonetheless, at present, medical treatments are considered the first line of interventions in treating young women. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder in which endometrial tissue is found outside the uterine cavity.Previous reports suggest that there is a dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis during the progression of endometriosis.Our previous report showed that a short-term treatment with antalarmin, a corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRHR1) antagonist decreases the number and size of endometriotic vesicles in the auto-transplantation rat model of endometriosis.Our current goal was to examine the mRNA expression of intra-adrenal receptors to better understand the mechanisms of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis involvement in endometriosis.We used two groups of female rats.The first received sham surgery or endometriosis surgery before collecting the adrenals after 7 days of the disease progression.The second group of animals received endometriosis surgery and a treatment of either vehicle or antalarmin (20 mg/kg, i.p.)during the first 7 days after endometriosis induction and then the disease was allowed to progress until day 60.Rats with sham surgery served as controls.Results showed that the mRNA expression of the mineralocorticoid (MRC2) receptor was lower in the rats after 7 days of endometriosis surgery and in rats with endometriosis that received antalarmin.In addition, the CRHR1 was significantly elevated in animals that received antalarmin and this was counteracted by a non-significant elevation in CRHR2 mRNA.The glucocorticoid receptor mRNA within the adrenals was not affected by endometriosis or antalarmin treatment.This report is one of the first to explore intra-adrenal mRNA for receptors involved in the HPA axis signaling as well as in the sympatho-adrenal signaling, calling for additional research towards understanding the role of the adrenal glands in chronic inflammatory diseases such as endometriosis. A high prevalence of menstrual disturbance has been reported among teenage girls, and research shows that there are delays in diagnosis of endometriosis among young girls.Using data from the Menstrual Disorder of Teenagers Survey (administered in 2005 and 2016), we propose a Gaussian copula model with graphical lasso prior to identify cohort differences in menstrual characteristics and to predict endometriosis.The model includes random effects to account for clustering by school, and we use the extended rank likelihood copula model to handle variables of mixed-type.The graphical lasso prior shrinks the elements in the precision matrix of a Gaussian distribution to encourage a sparse graphical structure, where the level of shrinkage is adaptable based on the strength of the conditional associations among questions in the survey.Applying our proposed model to the menstrual disorder data set, we found that menstrual disturbance was more pronouncedly reported over a decade, and we found some empirical differences between those girls with higher risk of developing endometriosis and the general population. Endometriosis and pelvic pain are associated.However, only half of the subtle and typical, and not all cystic and deep lesions are painful.The mechanism of the pain is explained by cyclical trauma and repair, an inflammatory reaction, activation of nociceptors up to 2.7 cm distance, painful adhesions and neural infiltration.The relationship between the severity of lesions and pain is variable.Diagnosis of the many causes requires laparoscopy and expertise.Imaging cannot exclude endometriosis.Surgical removal is the treatment of choice.Medical therapy without a diagnosis risks missing pathology and chronification of pain if not 100% effective.Indications and techniques of surgery are described as expert opinion since randomised controlled trials were not performed for ethical reasons, since not suited for multimorbidity while a control group is poorly accepted.Subtle endometriosis needs destruction since some cause pain or progress to more severe disease.Typical lesions need excision or vaporisation since depth can be misjudged by inspection.Painful cystic ovarian endometriosis needs adhesiolysis and either destruction of the lining or excision of the cyst wall, taking care to avoid ovarian damage.Cysts larger than 6 cm need a two-step technique or an ovariectomy.Excision of deep endometriosis is difficult and complication prone surgery involving bladder, ureter, and bowel surgery varying from excision and suturing, disc excision with a circular stapler and resection anastomosis.Completeness of excision, prevention of postoperative adhesions and recurrences of endometriosis, and the indication to explore large somatic nerves will be discussed. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 10% of women in reproductive age and manifested as infertility and pelvic pain, which may be severe and incapacitating.This review aims to address the latest evidence on the association of endometriosis with chronic stress, anxiety and depression, and to find out whether the effective treatment of endometriosis has the additional benefit of attenuating these psychological comorbidities.Studies have found that women with endometriosis, especially those with painful symptoms, have higher levels of stress and a decreased quality of life compared to healthy women.Importantly, depression and anxiety are more prevalent in women with endometriosis, and the presence of psychiatric disorders correlates more to the severity of the endometriosis-related pain than to other disease characteristics.Considering therapeutic implications, controlled clinical trials found that medical and surgical treatments of endometriosis also ameliorated perceived stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms.In conclusion, current evidence indicates that women with endometriosis have an increased prevalence of psychological disorders which correlate more with pain itself than with endometriosis per se.In addition, the effective treatment of endometriosis may reduce the psychological burden of the disease. Leiomyomas, adenomyosis, and endometriosis are reported to be risk factors for endometrial carcinoma (EC), and adenomyosis and endometriosis also for ovarian carcinoma (OC).We aimed to describe the prevalence of these conditions in EC patients with or without an OC diagnosis, and to investigate their relationship with EC risk and prognostic factors in these patients.We evaluated the co-existence of these three conditions in 1399 EC patients, and compared the prevalence of epidemiological risk factors and tumor prognostic features in patients with each condition versus not.Prevalence of conditions was also assessed in the subset of patients with prior/concurrent OC.The observed coexistence of leiomyomas, adenomyosis and endometriosis significantly deviated from that expected (P = 1.2 10-8).Patients were more likely to: report a younger age at menarche (PTrend = 0.004) if they had leiomyomas; have used oral contraceptives (P = 6.6 10-5) or had 2 full-term pregnancies (PTrend = 2.0 10-9) if they had adenomyosis; be diagnosed with EC at younger age (P = 5.0 10-11) if they had endometriosis.Patients with prior/concurrent OC were more likely to be diagnosed at younger age (P = 5.0 10-5), have endometriosis (P = 9.9 10-7), and present with higher stage EC (PTrend = 6.6 10-5).These findings justify further consideration of these gynecologic conditions as independent risk and prognostic factors for EC. Endometriosis is a painful gynecologic disease affecting one in ten reproductive aged women worldwide.Few studies have correlated this symptomatology with biomarker levels among women with and without endometriosis, and no studies correlating pain with biomarker levels have been performed in young patient populations.The purpose of this study was to examine whether CA125 correlates with different types and severity of pain among adolescents and young women with and without endometriosis and assess its performance as an endometriosis biomarker among those presenting with dysmenorrhea in this young population.Reproductive-aged women with laparoscopically-confirmed endometriosis (n = 282) and controls (n = 293) who participated in The Womens Health Study: From Adolescence to Adulthood (A2A), a cohort of adolescents and young women enrolled from 2012-2018, were included in this cross-sectional analysis.Plasma CA125 values were measured using WERF EPHect compliant blood samples collected at enrollment.Average CA125 were calculated by self-reported pain type (i.e.dysmenorrhea, non-cyclic/general pelvic pain, dyspareunia), severity, and frequency in endometriosis cases and controls.Median age at blood draw was 24 years in controls and 17 years in cases, with 68% and 89% non-Hispanic white, respectively.Most endometriosis cases (95%) were rASRM stage I/II.Average CA125 values were 12.5 U/mL in controls and 12.1 U/mL in cases adjusted for age.CA125 did not differ by pain type, its severity, or frequency in endometriosis cases or controls.Among participants who reported dysmenorrhea, CA125 did not discriminate endometriosis cases from controls using cutoff of 35 U/mL (AUC = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.50-0.53).Among adolescents and young adult women, CA125 did not correlate with pain type.CA125 did not efficiently discriminate endometriosis cases from controls even when accounting for pain symptomatology.Average CA125 values were low in adolescents and young women in both endometriosis cases and controls, suggesting cautious interpretation may be needed when measuring CA125 in this population. Tubal endometriosis (tubal EM) is a subtype of endometriosis (EM) associated with fallopian tube impairments and infertility.Since the molecular mechanism underlying tubal EM is not clear, we assume that an aberrant transcriptome of fallopian tube epithelium and microenvironment changes caused by cytokines in tubal fluid are possible causes.The aim of this study was to identify potential hub mRNAs/proteins of tubal EM through integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses and to elucidate significant pathways, cellular functions, and interaction networks during the initiation and progression of tubal EM.We obtained human fallopian tube epithelium and tubal fluid samples from patients with and without tubal EM.Tubal epithelia were analyzed using microarray, and tubal fluid was analyzed using quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS.We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and determined common mRNAs/protein.We observed 35 commonly deregulated mRNAs/proteins, and IPA indicated that cellular movement, inflammatory response, and immune cell trafficking were significantly activated during the pathogenesis of tubal EM.We also identified acute phase response signaling pathway activation as a unique pathogenesis signature of tubal EM.Our results demonstrate that an integrated analysis of the transcriptome and proteome has the potential to reveal novel disease mechanisms at a molecular level. Endometriosis is a disease of reproductive age women that is commonly characterized by symptoms that often negatively impact quality of life.The clinical management of endometriosis remains highly variable and mostly influenced by geographic location, practice patterns, and breadth of clinician experience.This variability in treatment has inspired a trend towards multidisciplinary and specialized care of patients suffering from this disease.Surgical sampling, followed by histologic confirmation of endometrial-like tissue, remains the standard for the definitive diagnosis of endometriosis.However, the high sensitivity and specificity of MRI and ultrasound has shed light on the path towards non-surgical diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriosis.Molecular variability and intricacy of this disease has limited the development of biologic markers to target for non-invasive diagnosis and pharmacologic therapies.Surgical management of advanced-stage endometriosis can be difficult, mostly secondary to the invasive nature of the disease, and anatomical distortion requiring advanced surgical skills to manage.The high prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and other complex pain syndromes in patients with endometriosis also requires knowledge in the management of these types of issues in order to provide comprehensive care.Menopausal endometriosis, extrapelvic presentation, and potential malignant transformation of lesions are infrequent, requiring a high index of suspicion for timely diagnosis and treatment.

Endometriosis is a relatively benign disease characterized by endometrial tumors and uterus stroma.Apoptosis suppression is one of the most important pathological processes of endometriosis.Recently, several studies reported that human Whartons jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) can inhibit growth and proliferation of various cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hWJSCs conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM) and cell-free lysate (hWJSC-CL) on endometriosis cells in vitro.In the present study, effects of different concentrations of hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL on viability and proliferation, morphological alterations, colony formation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of endometriosis cells were evaluated.Our results showed that hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL decrease viability and proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, as well as increase morphological alterations and apoptosis of endometriosis cells, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.Decreased migration and invasion of treated endometriosis cells with hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL may be due to decrease of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression.Moreover, induction of apoptosis in treated endometriosis cells can be due to regulation of apoptosis-related genes expression, including BAX, BCL-2, SMAC, and SURVIVIN.The results of the present study suggest that hWJSC-CM and hWJSC-CL can inhibit endometriosis cells at a mild-to-moderate level through various physiological mechanisms.However, further studies on animal models are necessary to achieve more accurate results. Endometriosis is a chronic benign disease that affects women of reproductive age.Medical therapy is often the first line of management for women with endometriosis in order to ameliorate symptoms or to prevent post-surgical disease recurrence.Currently, there are several medical options for the management of patients with endometriosis and long-term treatments should balance clinical efficacy (controlling pain symptoms and preventing recurrence of disease after surgery) with an acceptable safety-profile.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, being efficacious in relieving primary dysmenorrhea.Combined oral contraceptives and progestins, available for multiple routes of administration, are commonly administered as first-line hormonal therapies.Several studies demonstrated that they succeed in improving pain symptoms in the majority of patients; moreover, they are well tolerated and not expensive.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonists are prescribed when first line therapies are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated.Even if these drugs are efficacious in treating women not responding to COCs or progestins, they are not orally available and have a less favorable tolerability profile (needing an appropriate add-back therapy).Because few data are available on long-term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors they should be reserved only for women with symptoms who are refractory to other treatments only in a research environment.Almost all of the currently available treatment options for endometriosis suppress ovarian function and are not curative.For this reason, research into new drugs is unsurprisingly demanding.Amongst the drugs currently under investigation, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists have shown most promise, currently in late-stage clinical development.There is a number of potential future therapies currently tested only in vitro, in animal models of endometriosis or in early clinical studies with a small sample size.Further studies are necessary to conclude whether these treatments would be of value for the treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynecological disorder associated with pelvic pain symptoms and infertility.Ovarian cysts (endometriomas) are the most common localization of endometriosis in the pelvis.Considering non-invasive methods, transvaginal ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for endometrioma diagnosis.Laparoscopic removal of endometrioma is related to a damage to the ovarian reserve and should be limited to patients with suspicious cysts or unresponsive to medical treatment.The main goal of medical therapy of symptomatic endometrioma is the control of pain symptoms, while no benefits have been demonstrated in terms of improving fertility rates of women seeking pregnancy.The aim of medical treatment is the inhibition of ovulation, stop of menstruation and achievement of a stable hypo-hormonal milieu.Estroprogestins and progestins are indicated by guidelines as first line medications for symptomatic patients.Several hormonal treatments have been proposed for the treatment of symptomatic endometriomas.In particular, dienogest, a relatively new progestin, has shown promising results.Medical treatment should be conceived as a long-term treatment.Safety, tolerability, a low percentage of side effects and an easy route of administration are essential for patient acceptance and adherence to therapy. The preservation of ovarian reserve during laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) ovarian cystectomy is crucial for reproductive-age women.This study was a single-blinded, single-center, and randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of hemostatic agents on the preservation of ovarian reserve and hemostasis during LESS ovarian cystectomy.Patients with unilateral ovarian cyst were randomized to the hemostatic agent and coagulation groups according to the hemostasis method.Afterwards, the patients underwent LESS ovarian cystectomy, and hemostasis was performed after ovarian cyst excision according to the assigned hemostasis method.If hemostasis was not completed within 10 min.After discharge, the patients were followed until 3 months after surgery.We compared the hemoglobin, anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) levels, and ovarian volumes before surgery, and 2 days, 1 week, and 3 months after surgery (3 M-POST), and the decline ratio between the two groups.The decline ratio of serum AMH levels was greater at 3 M-POST in the coagulation than in the hemostatic agent group (median intention-to-treat [ITT], - 36.7 vs. - 13.3%; per-protocol [PP], - 36.8 vs. - 13.3%; P < 0.05).Notably, the difference of the decline ratio of serum AMH levels was only shown in endometriosis patients (median; ITT, - 50.7 vs. - 14.4%; PP, - 50.7% vs. - 14.4%; P < 0.05), while there was no difference in non-endometriosis patients.In conclusion, Hemostatic agents may be non-inferior to bipolar coagulation for preserving ovarian reserve and hemostasis during LESS ovarian cystectomy, in particular, for endometriosis patients.(Trial registry: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03374397). Endometriosis is a relatively common condition in which endometrial tissue is established in locations outside the uterus where, like the eutopic endometrium, it responds to hormonal stimuli and develops internal bleeding, inflammation, and fibrosis.These changes are associated with chronic and often debilitating cyclic pain and infertility.The pathogenesis of endometriosis is multifactorial, and several theories have been proposed to explain it.These include retrograde menstruation, celomic metaplasia, embryologic rests, and lymphovascular spread.Hormones, immunologic status, and genetic factors may also play a role.In most patients, the disease involves pelvic organs, but rarely it may also extend to a large variety of distant locations in the body.Patients with ovarian endometriosis are at higher risk for developing ovarian carcinomas including endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas.Some of these carcinomas may arise in a background of structural and/or nuclear atypia within the endometriotic foci.There is no known cure for endometriosis and treatment mostly consists of managing chronic pain or infertility.
